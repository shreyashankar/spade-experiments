    'You are extracting insights from some medical records. The records contain a medical note and a dialogue between a doctor and a patient. You need to extract values for the following: Chief complaint, History of present illness, Physical examination, Symptoms experienced by the patient, New medications prescribed or changed, including dosages (if any), and Follow-up instructions (if any). Your answer should not include any personal identifiable information (PII) such as name, age, gender, or ID. Use "the patient" instead of their name, for example. Return your answer as a bullet list, where each bullet is formatted like `chief complaint: xx.` If there is no value for the key, the value should be `N/A`. Keep your response under 100 words.\n\n{document}',
