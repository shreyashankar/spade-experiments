He is not sure if it is due to the change in the seasons or due to performing lots of projects and some construction on his home. He reports fatigue and lightheadedness. This has been going on for about 5 weeks. While exerting energy, he has experienced some shortness of breath and chest cramps. The patient also notes a slight cough, but he is not sure if it is just the change in seasons.\\n\\nHe feels bloated every once in a while. His diet has been a little bit of a struggle. They had construction on their kitchen begin over Labor Day weekend, and have been eating less healthy food as a result.\\n\\nRegarding his heart failure, he has been pretty good with his salt intake. He has been pretty good about his diet since the last year and is staying on top of that as much as possible. The patient has continued to utilize Lasix daily.\\n\\nFor his hypertension, this has been well controlled with lisinopril 20 mg a day. He has continued to monitor his blood pressure regularly.\\n\\nThe patient did the review of systems sheet when he checked in. He denies weight gain, swelling in the lower extremities, fevers, chills, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\\n\\n\\u2022 Constitutional: Endorses fatigue. Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss.\\n\\u2022 Cardiovascular: Endorses chest pain or dyspnea on exertion.\\n\\u2022 Respiratory: Endorses cough and shortness of breath.\\n\\u2022 Gastrointestinal: Endorses bloating.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\n\\n\\u2022 Neck: JVD 8 cm.\\n\\u2022 Respiratory: Rales bilateral bases.\\n\\u2022 Cardiovascular: 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.\\n\\u2022 Musculoskeletal: 1+ pitting edema bilateral lower extremities.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nX-ray of the chest demonstrates a mild amount of fluid in the lungs.\\n\\nEchocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction of 45% and mild mitral regurgitation.\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\\n\\nBrian White is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure and hypertension, who presents today for follow up of his chronic problems.\\n\\nCongestive heart failure.\\n\\u2022 Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased fatigue, dizziness, and chest discomfort on exertion. He also exhibits some jugular venous distention, lung base crackles, and lower extremity edema on exam today. He has been compliant with his current medications but admits to dietary indiscretion lately. His recent echocardiogram demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%, as well as mitral regurgitation.\\n\\u2022 Additional Testing: We will order a repeat echocardiogram.\\n\\u2022 Medical Treatment: Increase Lasix to 80 mg daily.\\n\\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor and record his daily weight and report those to me via the patient portal. He will contact me should he continue to experience any dyspnea.\\n\\nHypertension.\\n\\u2022 Medical Reasoning: This is well controlled based on home monitoring.\\n\\u2022 Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily.\\n\\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to monitor and record his blood pressures at home and report these to me via the patient portal.\\n\\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------\\nDIALOGUE:\\n\\n[doctor] hi , brian . how are you ?\\n[patient] hi , good to see you .\\n[doctor] it's good to see you too . so , i know the nurse told you a little bit about dax .\\n[patient] mm-hmm .\\n[doctor] i'd like to tell dax about you , okay ?\\n[patient] sure .\\n[doctor] so , brian is a 58 year old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure and hypertension , who presents today for follow-up of his chronic problems . so , brian , it's been a little while i've seen you .\\n[patient] mm-hmm .\\n[doctor] whats , what's going on ?\\n[patient] i , i just feel out of sorts lately . i do n't know if it's the change in the seasons or if we're just doing a lot of projects around the house and , and some , some construction on our own . i'm just feeling out of it . lack of , uh , energy . i'm just so tired and fatigued , and i feel kinda ... i feel lightheaded every once in a while .\\n[doctor] okay . all right . um , how long has that been going on for ?\\n[patient] uh , probably since labor day , so about five weeks or so .\\n[doctor] okay . and , have you noticed any , like , symptoms of weight gain , like , like swollen legs , or , you know , your belly feels bloated and things like that ?\\n[patient] i feel , i feel bloated every once in a while .\\n[doctor] okay . all right . um , and , are you taking your , your medications ?\\n[patient] uh , yes , i am .\\n[doctor] okay . and , how about your diet ?
