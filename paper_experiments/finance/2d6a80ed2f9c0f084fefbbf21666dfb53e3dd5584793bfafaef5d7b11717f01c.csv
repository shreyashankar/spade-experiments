Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shelly Kay Pfeiffer,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heath Patrick Terry,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. Really appreciate this. Just on the AWS business, as you look sort of at the strength that you saw in the quarter, particularly represented by the amount of dollars added quarter-over-quarter, is there anything in particular that you would call out either in terms of specific types of workloads, regions, specific customer types that you felt like drove the strength, particularly relative to the directional -- direction of growth that we were seeing in the earlier parts of the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No, I would not isolate it to any one set of customers or products. I think it's been pretty broad-based. And it's kind of the culmination of a lot of work on adding new products and features, adding to our sales and marketing teams and having better penetration in enterprise customers and hitting a lot of very different industries. So I think that's what you're seeing. We feel that our product set is -- leads the market. And we add to it at a quicker pace than our competition, so actually, the gap on capacity and features is growing as we speak.
We also think that there's a real network effect when you use AWS with the millions of active customers and tens of thousands of global partners. And we continue to expand. We're now in 69 availability zones across 22 geographic regions. So I think it's the combination of increased sales support, more and better products that hit customers' needs and also the geographic expansion is what you're seeing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Alan Sebastian,  Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Was just hoping you guys could disaggregate a bit the strength in seller services, how much of that was third-party marketplace commission specifically? And are you seeing more of an uptick in some of the other content and services?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On seller services, I would say it was just a very strong quarter, if that's what you're referring to, 31% growth in revenue. It was strong on a unit basis. And as you said, there's probably additional strength in FBA, which has higher fee set than MFN does. So -- but in general, if you step away, I think what you're seeing is more and more participation of third-party sellers in our one-day delivery program as we move through the year. That was particularly strong in Q4, and I think you'll see that more as we move into 2020.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just wondering if you could go high level what drove upside to your guidance on revenue in the quarter on the retail side. Anything there that you'd really call out? And then on the AWS investments, obviously, you just talked about investments starting in 3Q. Where are you in that investment? Your margins are still below peak. Where are you kind of in that investment cycle?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Well, as I said, on revenue, we came in at $87.4 billion, which exceeded the high end of our range of $86.5 billion. $400 million of -- roughly $400 million of that was due to foreign exchange. But what we saw was essentially very strong holiday performance from the middle of November on. We also had a very big uptick in response to the one-day availability that's been building through the year.
I think Prime has been very strong. We mentioned that we have more than 150 million paid Prime members globally now. And we mentioned that more people joined Prime in Q4 than any other quarter before. So a lot of good momentum there built up on the aggregation of benefits that we continue to add to the Prime program, most recently the one-day -- expansion of one-day shipping.
On AWS, where are we in the cycle? I talked more in 2018, when the margins in AWS were closer to 30%, about the efficiency of infrastructure spend and -- versus prior years. So we continue to -- since that point, we've continued to add infrastructure capability and -- to support our global expansion as well. But what you're seeing probably more in the margins is the expansion of our sales and marketing effort at some of those costs as well as price decreases and longer-term contracts that we've signed with some of our customers. You notice on our balance sheet that our future commitments on the multiyear deals now stands at $30 billion at year-end, and that's up 54% year-over-year. So there's a lot of good momentum on the enterprise side as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Co.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jason Stuart Helfstein,  Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Internet Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just to ask about AWS again. The investors have become, I guess, recently concerned just about, again, the slowing AWS revenue and margin and whether it's a function of increased competition. So maybe just talk about how you're reacting. You did talk about spending on sales and price cuts. But just any more you can talk about the competitive environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. I would probably argue a bit with the growth comments. As we see it here, we grew from a $30 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2018 to a $40 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2019. So we continue to be happy with our top line growth. The -- in dollar terms as opposed to percentages, we had a larger dollar increase in revenue, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. So we're very happy with the progress of the revenue and our adoption and acceptance by customers.
As far as competitive set is concerned, we -- again, we think that we have -- start with a very big lead in this space because of our many years of investment, not only in capacity but also in services and features that we provide to customers. We've learned from customers. We just had a great re:Invent conference in December, where all of our -- it was a great aggregation of partners and customers and developers. And at those events, we not only get to present our new products, and there were over 100 that were launched in December, but we also get to hear customer issues and help -- that helps sign our -- educate our forward road map.
So it's a great shared learning. I think customers react to it. Customers will be at different stages of their adoption curve. There's always different phases: first, moving to the cloud, then organizing on the cloud and then growing further. So there's a lot of movement. I said that repeatedly, I think, in the setting that any quarter -- quarter-to-quarter movement is going to be a little bumpy. But generally, what you're seeing is the convergence of a lot of investment, a lot of operational efficiency and a lot of innovation on behalf of customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Cr√©dit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen D. Ju,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I wanted to switch it up a little bit. I guess you guys called this out in your press release, but I'm wondering if you could talk about your efforts to get the SMBs and the micro SMBs online in India. What exactly is involved from a practical perspective? Do you need to have door-to-door sales folks? And what can you do to r

- Amazon's Q4 2019 revenue reached $87.4 billion, topping the high end of their forecasted range ($86.5 billion). This figure includes a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately $400 million.
- AWS demonstrated significant growth, moving from a $30 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2018 to a $40 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2019, which the CFO characterized as a substantial expansion in both yearly and sequential dollar terms.
- Third-party seller services grew by 31%, bolstered by strong holiday performance and higher fee sets associated with Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), compared to Merchant Fulfilled Network (MFN) operations.
- Commitments for future multiyear deals for AWS tallied at $30 billion by year-end, marking a 54% increase year-over-year.
  
**Qualitative Performance Nuances:**

- The surge in Amazon's Q4 revenue was attributed to robust holiday sales starting from mid-November and increased uptake in one-day delivery offerings.
- Prime membership saw substantial growth, exceeding 150 million paid members globally, with Q4 seeing the highest number of new sign-ups ever.
- The CFO did not attribute AWS's growth to any single factor but cited a broad base of growth across various customer segments, new product features, sales and marketing expansion, global presence, and industry penetration.
- AWS's margin dynamics were explained in context with increased infrastructure spending, sales, and marketing expansions, pricing strategies, including price reductions and long-term contracts.
- The CFO dismissed concerns over AWS's slowing growth, instead underscoring the positive momentum and stressing the impracticality of linear growth expectations in the face of varying customer adoption phases and investment cycles.
  
**Forward Guidance Context:**

- Amazon‚Äôs guidance includes current order trends and what the company perceives as reasonable assumptions about future performance. 
- The guidance presupposes no further business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements which might be material, emphasizing the unpredictability of demand and potential influence from a host of factors including exchange rates, economic conditions, world events, and industry growth rates.
- The guidance incorporates assumptions that do not account for the eventualities of additional business dealings, such as acquisitions or legal settlements.
  
**Consolidated Themes and Relevant Details:**

- **Seasonality and Demand Pattern:** Robust demand observed during the holiday season with one-day shipping being a key driver of customer purchases.
- **Sales and Investments:** AWS growth was partially ascribed to an expansion in the sales team and investment in new products, potentially affecting margin profiles.
- **Market and Competitive Position:** AWS continues to face competition but emphasizes its lead due to longstanding investments and service offerings. Competitive factors include new contract structures, customer diversification, and geographic expansion.
- **Strategic Focus on SMBs:** Amazon notably signals efforts toward engaging small and medium businesses, particularly in emerging markets like India, suggesting an increased focus on global market penetration.

**Detailed Contextual Explanations:**

- Concerning AWS margins, the discussion provided by CFO Olsavsky points to a strategic approach of investing in capacities, both technical and geographic, and enhancement of sales and marketing forces rather than suggesting direct margin compression due to competition alone.
- In discussing revenue drivers, forecast accuracy, and business performance, detailed explanations are provided around the effects of extended one-day shipping, Prime membership growth, and robust holiday sales, indicating a specific focus on end-to-end consumer experience as a growth lever.
- The forward guidance reflects cautious optimism, grounded in current operational trends and without incorporating the potential for significant strategic shifts that could alter financial outcomes. There is an acknowledgment of inherent unpredictability in demand for Amazon‚Äôs goods and services.
  
**Additional Notes:**

- There was no detail provided around the typical deterrents like seasonality, macroeconomic conditions, or specific cost-saving initiatives.
- No data regarding capital expenditure, EBITDA, capital structure, debt, free cash flow, hedges, liquidity, or operating expenses besides what has been mentioned, was offered in the presented text.
- The extracted information is devoid of speculative remarks and avoids drawing any conclusions beyond the provided data and management‚Äôs commentary.

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heath Patrick Terry,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. Really appreciate this. Just on the AWS business, as you look sort of at the strength that you saw in the quarter, particularly represented by the amount of dollars added quarter-over-quarter, is there anything in particular that you would call out either in terms of specific types of workloads, regions, specific customer types that you felt like drove the strength, particularly relative to the directional -- direction of growth that we were seeing in the earlier parts of the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No, I would not isolate it to any one set of customers or products. I think it's been pretty broad-based. And it's kind of the culmination of a lot of work on adding new products and features, adding to our sales and marketing teams and having better penetration in enterprise customers and hitting a lot of very different industries. So I think that's what you're seeing. We feel that our product set is -- leads the market. And we add to it at a quicker pace than our competition, so actually, the gap on capacity and features is growing as we speak.
We also think that there's a real network effect when you use AWS with the millions of active customers and tens of thousands of global partners. And we continue to expand. We're now in 69 availability zones across 22 geographic regions. So I think it's the combination of increased sales support, more and better products that hit customers' needs and also the geographic expansion is what you're seeing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Alan Sebastian,  Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Was just hoping you guys could disaggregate a bit the strength in seller services, how much of that was third-party marketplace commission specifically? And are you seeing more of an uptick in some of the other content and services?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On seller services, I would say it was just a very strong quarter, if that's what you're referring to, 31% growth in revenue. It was strong on a unit basis. And as you said, there's probably additional strength in FBA, which has higher fee set than MFN does. So -- but in general, if you step away, I think what you're seeing is more and more participation of third-party sellers in our one-day delivery program as we move through the year. That was particularly strong in Q4, and I think you'll see that more as we move into 2020.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just wondering if you could go high level what drove upside to your guidance on revenue in the quarter on the retail side. Anything there that you'd really call out? And then on the AWS investments, obviously, you just talked about investments starting in 3Q. Where are you in that investment? Your margins are still below peak. Where are you kind of in that investment cycle?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Well, as I said, on revenue, we came in at $87.4 billion, which exceeded the high end of our range of $86.5 billion. $400 million of -- roughly $400 million of that was due to foreign exchange. But what we saw was essentially very strong holiday performance from the middle of November on. We also had a very big uptick in response to the one-day availability that's been building through the year.
I think Prime has been very strong. We mentioned that we have more than 150 million paid Prime members globally now. And we mentioned that more people joined Prime in Q4 than any other quarter before. So a lot of good momentum there built up on the aggregation of benefits that we continue to add to the Prime program, most recently the one-day -- expansion of one-day shipping.
On AWS, where are we in the cycle? I talked more in 2018, when the margins in AWS were closer to 30%, about the efficiency of infrastructure spend and -- versus prior years. So we continue to -- since that point, we've continued to add infrastructure capability and -- to support our global expansion as well. But what you're seeing probably more in the margins is the expansion of our sales and marketing effort at some of those costs as well as price decreases and longer-term contracts that we've signed with some of our customers. You notice on our balance sheet that our future commitments on the multiyear deals now stands at $30 billion at year-end, and that's up 54% year-over-year. So there's a lot of good momentum on the enterprise side as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Co.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jason Stuart Helfstein,  Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Internet Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just to ask about AWS again. The investors have become, I guess, recently concerned just about, again, the slowing AWS revenue and margin and whether it's a function of increased competition. So maybe just talk about how you're reacting. You did talk about spending on sales and price cuts. But just any more you can talk about the competitive environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. I would probably argue a bit with the growth comments. As we see it here, we grew from a $30 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2018 to a $40 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2019. So we continue to be happy with our top line growth. The -- in dollar terms as opposed to percentages, we had a larger dollar increase in revenue, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. So we're very happy with the progress of the revenue and our adoption and acceptance by customers.
As far as competitive set is concerned, we -- again, we think that we have -- start with a very big lead in this space because of our many years of investment, not only in capacity but also in services and features that we provide to customers. We've learned from customers. We just had a great re:Invent conference in December, where all of our -- it was a great aggregation of partners and customers and developers. And at those events, we not only get to present our new products, and there were over 100 that were launched in December, but we also get to hear customer issues and help -- that helps sign our -- educate our forward road map.
So it's a great shared learning. I think customers react to it. Customers will be at different stages of their adoption curve. There's always different phases: first, moving to the cloud, then organizing on the cloud and then growing further. So there's a lot of movement. I said that repeatedly, I think, in the setting that any quarter -- quarter-to-quarter movement is going to be a little bumpy. But generally, what you're seeing is the convergence of a lot of investment, a lot of operational efficiency and a lot of innovation on behalf of customers.

          Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Cr√©dit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen D. Ju,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I wanted to switch it up a little bit. I guess you guys called this out in your press release, but I'm wondering if you could talk about your efforts to get the SMBs and the micro SMBs online in India. What exactly is involved from a practical perspective? Do you need to have door-to-door sales folks? And what can you do to r

1. Revenue: Amazon reported revenue of $87.4 billion for Q4 2019, exceeding the high end of their range of $86.5 billion. The strong performance was driven by a very strong holiday season and an uptick in response to the one-day availability offered by the company.

2. AWS Growth: Amazon Web Services (AWS) grew its revenue from a $30 billion run rate at the end of 2018 to a $40 billion run rate at the end of 2019. The company emphasized the broad-based strength of its AWS business, citing the addition of new products and features, increased sales and marketing efforts, better penetration in enterprise customers, and expansion into different industries.

3. Competitive Environment: Amazon believes it has a significant lead in the cloud services space due to its years of investment in capacity, services, and features. The company highlighted the positive feedback and shared learning it gains from customers at events like the re:Invent conference. While competitive dynamics exist, Amazon remains confident in its innovation and operational efficiency.

4. Seller Services: Seller services revenue grew by 31% in Q4 2019, driven by strong performance on a unit basis and increased participation of third-party sellers in Amazon's one-day delivery program. The company expects this trend to continue in 2020.

5. Prime Membership: Amazon reached more than 150 million paid Prime members globally in Q4 2019, with the highest number of new members joining in any quarter. The company attributed this growth to the aggregation of benefits and recent expansion of one-day shipping.

6. Financial Guidance: Amazon's revenue outperformed its guidance for Q4 2019. The company highlighted the unpredictability of its results and the potential impact of various factors such as foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions, and customer spending. Amazon's guidance incorporates order trends and assumes no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements.

7. AWS Margins: While AWS saw the expansion of sales and marketing efforts and price decreases, Amazon emphasized the efficiency of its infrastructure spending compared to previous years. The company also highlighted the growth in long-term contracts with customers, which contributed to increased commitments and served as a positive indicator for the enterprise side of AWS.

8. Efforts in India: Amazon mentioned its efforts to bring small and micro-sized businesses online in India. The company did not provide specific details on the practical aspects but expressed a focus on expanding its presence and services in the Indian market.

Overall, Amazon delivered strong financial results, driven by revenue growth in its core retail business and AWS. The company remains confident in its competitive position, innovation capabilities, and the continued expansion of its services and product offerings.",gpt-3

As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first-quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $6.4 billion, up from $3.2 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $3.5 billion up from $1.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less financed lease principal repayments and assets required under capital leases increased to $1.6 billion, up from an outflow of $1.2 billion.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.9 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance and lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares compared with 483 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue increased 28% to $29.1 billion, or 29% excluding the $210 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide active customer accounts, excluding customers who only had pre-orders in the preceding 12-month period, exceeded 285 million. Worldwide paid unit growth was 27%. Worldwide seller units represented 48% of paid units.
Now, I'll talk about our segment results. In the first quarter of 2016, we began to allocate stock-based compensation and other operating expense net to our segment results. These amounts are combined and titled stock-based compensation and other in our segment results and reflect the way we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations. For reference this quarter, I'll also mention segment operating income excluding stock-based compensation and other.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 27% to $17 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $3.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 32% to $13.5 billion. North America segment operating income including stock-based compensation and other was $588 million, a 3.5% operating margin compared with $254 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. North America's segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $924 million, a 5.4% operating margin compared with $517 million in the prior year.
In the international segment, revenue grew 24% to $9.6 billion. Excluding the $177 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 26%. Media revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion, or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $7 billion, or 33% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating loss including stock-based compensation and other was $121 million compared with a loss of $194 million in the prior year. This includes $21 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $20 million compared with a loss of $76 million in the prior year.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 64% to $2.6 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income including stock-based compensation and other was $604 million, a 23.5% operating margin compared with $195 million in the prior year. This includes $24 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Amazon Web Services segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $716 million, a 27.9% operating margin compared with $265 million in the prior year.
Our operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. Operating income was $1.1 billion, or 3.7% of revenue, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. This includes $50 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $1.7 billion, or 5.7% of revenue compared to $706 million in the prior year. Our income tax expense was $475 million. Net income was $513 million, or $1.07 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $57 million, or loss of $0.12 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.1 billion year-over-year to $15.9 billion. Inventory increased 30% to $9.6 billion, and inventory turns were 8.6 down from 8.8 turns a year ago as we expand selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 26% to $15 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 70 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. It is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling inter-Company balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on our results. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2016, we expect net sales of between $28 billion and $30.5 billion, or growth of between 21% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $375 million and $975 million compared with $464 million in second-quarter 2015. This includes approximately $825 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expense net.
We are grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And, with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.

          Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

          (Operator Instructions)
Our first question is from Mark May of Citi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks a lot. Lots here, but international retail revenue -- the international retail segment really stood out. Revenue accelerated. Seemed like a bit of a milestone also that the CSOI turned positive in a non-Q4 quarter. Can you shed any more light in what the key driver there was? And, how sustainable it is? And, AWS just mathematically, the comps get tougher starting in Q2, just given what happened in 2014. Is that something that we should be taking into account in terms of thinking about how the rest of the year may progress? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Your first question on international. Yes, all three segments had very strong growth in the quarter. International's 26% for FX-neutral growth rate was actually the strongest we've seen in 3.5 years. I would attribute it to the Prime Fly Wheel. As we may have mentioned in the past -- feel that Europe and the large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years behind the US on a lot of the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year-over-year in 2015. 47% of that was in the US and a higher rate than that internationally.
So, certainly a lot going on in the international. A lot that's really good adding Prime subscribers at a high clip. Continuing to add selection at FBA sellers. So, you'll see devices, you see video content. It's the whole array of Prime offering. Prime Now, Same-day, everything is in Europe. Maybe getting there a little slower than starting point at the US. We see it really showing up in customer engagement and customer purchases.
On the AWS side, I think the 2016 to 2015 comparison probably stands on its own and 2014 falls by the wayside so I would encourage you to look at recent trends. We don't forecast, obviously, by segment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask you about unit growth overall and if we look back over the last three quarters, you've accelerated it now to a materially higher level than what we saw in 2014 and the first half of 2015, and I realize in 3Q last year you had Prime Day. I was hoping you could comment on the overall acceleration we've seen here and key drivers behind that? And, if there's something different perhaps than what you talked about on international?
Also, on AWS, can you talk about the underlying drivers here of margins and thinking about that a little bit going forward primary sources of leverage? As you open up six new regions in coming months, should we expect this to be constant build-out? Or, something that's more lumpy over time and more in waves? Thanks.

- The guidance assumes status quo foreign exchange rates, no major business changes such as acquisitions, or unforeseen legal settlements. It also assumes no alterations to stock-based compensation estimates.

### Business Growth and Investment:

- Investment in technology infrastructure, primarily for AWS, and capacity for fulfillment operations were reflected in the capital expenditures.
- The Prime ecosystem's growth in Europe and Japan, which lag behind the US, was seen as a significant growth factor internationally.
- Increasing selection and improving in-stock levels are part of the strategy to enhance customer experience.

### Segment-Specific Insights:

- North America's growth is driven by Prime penetration and EGM (Electronics and General Merchandise) revenue which soared by 32% to $13.5 billion.
- International improvement attributable to higher Prime subscriptions and strategic investments in key services and product categories.
- AWS shows robust growth and margin enhancement, with the significant income increase linked to broader service adoption and scale efficiencies. The expansion includes six new regions in the coming months.

          Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2016 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.

          Hello and welcome to our Q1 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, April 28, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.

Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first-quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $6.4 billion, up from $3.2 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $3.5 billion up from $1.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less financed lease principal repayments and assets required under capital leases increased to $1.6 billion, up from an outflow of $1.2 billion.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.9 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance and lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares compared with 483 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue increased 28% to $29.1 billion, or 29% excluding the $210 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide active customer accounts, excluding customers who only had pre-orders in the preceding 12-month period, exceeded 285 million. Worldwide paid unit growth was 27%. Worldwide seller units represented 48% of paid units.
Now, I'll talk about our segment results. In the first quarter of 2016, we began to allocate stock-based compensation and other operating expense net to our segment results. These amounts are combined and titled stock-based compensation and other in our segment results and reflect the way we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations. For reference this quarter, I'll also mention segment operating income excluding stock-based compensation and other.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 27% to $17 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $3.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 32% to $13.5 billion. North America segment operating income including stock-based compensation and other was $588 million, a 3.5% operating margin compared with $254 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. North America's segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $924 million, a 5.4% operating margin compared with $517 million in the prior year.
In the international segment, revenue grew 24% to $9.6 billion. Excluding the $177 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 26%. Media revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion, or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $7 billion, or 33% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating loss including stock-based compensation and other was $121 million compared with a loss of $194 million in the prior year. This includes $21 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $20 million compared with a loss of $76 million in the prior year.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 64% to $2.6 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income including stock-based compensation and other was $604 million, a 23.5% operating margin compared with $195 million in the prior year. This includes $24 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Amazon Web Services segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $716 million, a 27.9% operating margin compared with $265 million in the prior year.
Our operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. Operating income was $1.1 billion, or 3.7% of revenue, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. This includes $50 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $1.7 billion, or 5.7% of revenue compared to $706 million in the prior year. Our income tax expense was $475 million. Net income was $513 million, or $1.07 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $57 million, or loss of $0.12 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.1 billion year-over-year to $15.9 billion. Inventory increased 30% to $9.6 billion, and inventory turns were 8.6 down from 8.8 turns a year ago as we expand selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 26% to $15 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 70 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. It is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling inter-Company balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on our results. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2016, we expect net sales of between $28 billion and $30.5 billion, or growth of between 21% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $375 million and $975 million compared with $464 million in second-quarter 2015. This includes approximately $825 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expense net.
We are grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And, with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.

          Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions)
Our first question is from Mark May of Citi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks a lot. Lots here, but international retail revenue -- the international retail segment really stood out. Revenue accelerated. Seemed like a bit of a milestone also that the CSOI turned positive in a non-Q4 quarter. Can you shed any more light in what the key driver there was? And, how sustainable it is? And, AWS just mathematically, the comps get tougher starting in Q2, just given what happened in 2014. Is that something that we should be taking into account in terms of thinking about how the rest of the year may progress? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Your first question on international. Yes, all three segments had very strong growth in the quarter. International's 26% for FX-neutral growth rate was actually the strongest we've seen in 3.5 years. I would attribute it to the Prime Fly Wheel. As we may have mentioned in the past -- feel that Europe and the large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years behind the US on a lot of the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year-over-year in 2015. 47% of that was in the US and a higher rate than that internationally.
So, certainly a lot going on in the international. A lot that's really good adding Prime subscribers at a high clip. Continuing to add selection at FBA sellers. So, you'll see devices, you see video content. It's the whole array of Prime offering. Prime Now, Same-day, everything is in Europe. Maybe getting there a little slower than starting point at the US. We see it really showing up in customer engagement and customer purchases.
On the AWS side, I think the 2016 to 2015 comparison probably stands on its own and 2014 falls by the wayside so I would encourage you to look at recent trends. We don't forecast, obviously, by segment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask you about unit growth overall and if we look back over the last three quarters, you've accelerated it now to a materially higher level than what we saw in 2014 and the first half of 2015, and I realize in 3Q last year you had Prime Day. I was hoping you could comment on the overall acceleration we've seen here and key drivers behind that? And, if there's something different perhaps than what you talked about on international?
Also, on AWS, can you talk about the underlying drivers here of margins and thinking about that a little bit going forward primary sources of leverage? As you open up six new regions in coming months, should we expect this to be constant build-out? Or, something that's more lumpy over time and more in waves? Thanks.

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 24, 2019, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet; online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I wanted to know if I can go a little bit deeper in the framework you gave around revenue guidance for Q4. Historically, you have seen deceleration in the year-on-year growth rate in Q4 versus Q3, but many of your businesses look like they reaccelerated in Q3 over Q2. So just wanted to know whether it was AWS or advertising or some of the things in the e-commerce business, whether there are things we should be keeping in front of mind from a headwind or tailwind perspective as we dig through some of the moving pieces in Q4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Eric. Yes. Let me make clear. We are really excited and looking forward to a great holiday season. We feel like we had a great Q3 as well and have made rapid progress on our one-day shipping. The Ops team has done a great job getting us in a position where we're in, and I think it's going to be a great additional service for customers in Q4.
On the guidance front, here's what I would have you keep in mind. If you look back over the last few years and adjust for the acquisition of Whole Foods and Souq, which obscured this a bit in the last couple years. There's been a noticeable drop in run rate between Q2 -- or excuse me, Q3 and Q4 generally along the lines about 300 basis points. We are factoring that in this year. That's just something we're expecting. It's a bit about the law of large numbers and the differential between growth in the holiday season, that very tight few weeks of the holiday season versus the rest of the year, but -- so we factored that in.
And then there's also 2 other issues. The Diwali holiday in India was all in Q4 last year, and a bit of it was in Q3 this year. Also, the Japan consumption tax was raised from 8% to 10% on October 1. And what we saw was a prebuy a bit in Q3 at the end of the quarter. And based on our history with the last time that consumption tax went up many years ago, we've expected a slight negative impact from that tax in Q4 in Japan. So if you wrap those together, we expect it's going to be more of an issue with our international growth rate. I would say it's -- has made -- have helped us by 150 basis points in Q3 and will be a negative headwind of 300 basis points year-over-year in Q4.
For the company, it's not as large an issue at -- it's about 40 basis points of favorability in Q3 and it's expected to be about an 80 basis point headwind in Q4.
So that's a little bit more on our guidance, but again, we're looking -- really looking forward to Q4. I think we're well positioned to make it the best holiday ever for our customers. I think one day should help with holiday shipping. We've got a great new device line up you may have seen announced in September. And on the AWS side, we're looking forward to our re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, where we welcome over 65,000 conference attendees.

          Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Brian, just wanted to ask you kind of more broadly about Prime One-Day, what your biggest learnings have been so far over the past several months as you've been increasing availability. And then how should we think about that availability now when we get into the heart of the holiday season? And can you also just help us understand how that's playing into your operating income guidance for 4Q?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, sure. Let me start with the second part of that. So we're -- back in Q2, I said that we were estimating an $800 million expense in -- tied to one-day in Q2, and we actually were just above that in Q2.
In Q3, we expected that to grow. We've put it into our guidance, and we hit essentially where we expected on the guidance. So as we head into Q4, we've added what's just nearly $1.5 billion penalty in Q4 year-over-year for the cost of shipping, which is essentially transportation cost, the cost of expanding our transportation capacity, things like adding additional pulls in shifts in our warehouses, the cost of forward deploying inventory closer to customers. There's a lot of tangential costs. But by and away, the biggest expenses is on the actual transportation cost.
So we've built that into our Q4 guidance estimate. But we're very pleased with the customer response to one-day. You can see it in our revenue acceleration and also in our unit growth acceleration. Once again, the Ops team has really done yeoman's work here to create this capacity for us, and they continue to unlock additional capacity daily. We're expecting that it will be, again, a great help to customers in Q4. We have seen Prime members increase their orders, spend more, so they must also see it as a real help to them in their daily lives.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Youssef Houssaini Squali,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Brian, just a couple of quick ones. Of the 400 basis point sequential acceleration growth, can you help us just understand maybe how much of that was driven by Prime Day, which I think you guys said was a record day for you versus one-day shipping. Just trying to extract one versus the other because, obviously going into Q4, you're only going to have the latter.
And then on a lot of news around counterfeit and whatnot on the site, can you just help quantify that for us if there is a way for you to do that? And is the higher OpEx for Q4 also driven, at least in part, by the higher investment to combat that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, sure. So on the second one, I would say, the -- we're certainly very diligent on the -- trying to catch counterfeit products. I would put a lot of effort into that. We put a lot of human effort. We put a lot of machine learning and algorithmic effort into that as well. But I would say the bigger investments in Q4 are certainly twofold, one, around the AWS -- excuse me, the one-day shipping that I just mentioned. The other would be on AWS. We have -- we continue to invest in AWS. If you look at the progression of our operating margin in that business, we've reached a high of 31% last Q4 -- or excuse me, Q3. That was a time when we were -- as we mentioned at that time, it was very efficient. We had been banking some savings from forward investments in infrastructure in 2017. We continue to feel really good about not only the top line but also the bottom line in that business, but we are investing a lot more this year in sales force and marketing personnel mainly to handle a wider group of customers, a increasingly wide group of products. We continue to add thousands of new products and features a year, and we continue to expand geographically.
So the biggest impact that we saw in Q3 year-over-year in the AWS segment was tied to costs related to sales and marketing year-over-year and also, to secondary extent, infrastructure, which, if you look at our capital leases or equipment leases line, it grew 30% on trailing 12-month basis in Q3 of this year, and that was 9% last year. So there's been a step-up in infrastructure cost to support the higher usage demand. So we see those trends continuing into Q4, and that's essentially probably the other element of operating income year-over-year that's shorter than in prior quarters.

          Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have 2. Just to go back to the one-day cost, appreciate the color. Be curious to hear about how you think about what portion of these costs are sort of transitory versus structural. It sounds like there are some shipping costs in there. Can you just sort of talk to some of the steps you have to take over the next 1 to 2 years to get the one-day shipping cost closer to what

Can you just sort of talk to some of the steps you have to take over the next 1 to 2 years to get the one-day shipping cost closer to what ""}","Key Insights from Amazon.com Inc Q3 2019 Earnings Call:

**Revenue Guidance Context:**
- Amazon expects a historical trend of a deceleration of year-on-year growth rate in Q4 compared to Q3. The company is preparing for this by taking into account a usual drop of around 300 basis points between Q3 and Q4.
- Specific factors for Q4 guidance discussed include the timing of the Diwali holiday and the Japan consumption tax hike. Diwali's earlier timing this year brings a 150 basis points gain in Q3 and a 300 basis point headwind in Q4 for international growth.
- For the overall company, this results in a 40 basis point gain in Q3 and an 80 basis point headwind in Q4.

**Prime One-Day Shipping:**
- The company has near a $1.5 billion cost penalty in Q4 year-on-year associated with one-day shipping, primarily for transportation and capacity expansion.
- Prime One-Day has led to revenue and unit growth acceleration, with Prime members increasing orders and spending more.

**Operating Income Guidance:**
- The expected Q4 operating income reflects the cost of one-day shipping as mentioned above.
- Investments are also directed towards AWS, particularly in sales force and marketing to handle a broader customer base and an increasing number of products and features.
- Infrastructure costs support higher usage demand, with a 30% growth in equipment leases on a trailing 12-month basis in Q3.

**E-Commerce and Cloud Services Dynamics:**
- Positive customer reception to Prime One-Day shipping is noticed in revenue acceleration.
- Amazon has a new device lineup anticipated to benefit Q4 sales.
- AWS is expected to have a presence with re:Invent conference, drawing over 65,000 attendees.

**Counterfeit Combat Costs:**
- Although specific costs weren't quantified, the company has been proactive in combating counterfeit products with investments in human capital and machine learning.
- The increased operating expenses for Q4 do not specifically mention investment in anti-counterfeit measures, and it appears to be less of a factor compared to one-day shipping and AWS investments.

**No Forward-Looking Financial Predictions:**
- Guidance incorporates current order trends and what is deemed appropriate assumptions but acknowledges the inherent unpredictability of results due to various factors.
- Guidance assumptions also note that it does not include potential impacts from additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements.

In summary, the provided key insights from the earnings call transcript focus on the expected slowdown in growth rate in Q4, significant investment in one-day shipping and its expected impact on revenue and unit growth, and continued investment in AWS infrastructure and sales capacities. The company also acknowledges various factors that could influence its financial performance, including macroeconomic conditions, foreign exchange rates, and customer spending patterns.",gpt-4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I wanted to know if I can go a little bit deeper in the framework you gave around revenue guidance for Q4. Historically, you have seen deceleration in the year-on-year growth rate in Q4 versus Q3, but many of your businesses look like they reaccelerated in Q3 over Q2. So just wanted to know whether it was AWS or advertising or some of the things in the e-commerce business, whether there are things we should be keeping in front of mind from a headwind or tailwind perspective as we dig through some of the moving pieces in Q4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Eric. Yes. Let me make clear. We are really excited and looking forward to a great holiday season. We feel like we had a great Q3 as well and have made rapid progress on our one-day shipping. The Ops team has done a great job getting us in a position where we're in, and I think it's going to be a great additional service for customers in Q4.
On the guidance front, here's what I would have you keep in mind. If you look back over the last few years and adjust for the acquisition of Whole Foods and Souq, which obscured this a bit in the last couple years. There's been a noticeable drop in run rate between Q2 -- or excuse me, Q3 and Q4 generally along the lines about 300 basis points. We are factoring that in this year. That's just something we're expecting. It's a bit about the law of large numbers and the differential between growth in the holiday season, that very tight few weeks of the holiday season versus the rest of the year, but -- so we factored that in.
And then there's also 2 other issues. The Diwali holiday in India was all in Q4 last year, and a bit of it was in Q3 this year. Also, the Japan consumption tax was raised from 8% to 10% on October 1. And what we saw was a prebuy a bit in Q3 at the end of the quarter. And based on our history with the last time that consumption tax went up many years ago, we've expected a slight negative impact from that tax in Q4 in Japan. So if you wrap those together, we expect it's going to be more of an issue with our international growth rate. I would say it's -- has made -- have helped us by 150 basis points in Q3 and will be a negative headwind of 300 basis points year-over-year in Q4.
For the company, it's not as large an issue at -- it's about 40 basis points of favorability in Q3 and it's expected to be about an 80 basis point headwind in Q4.
So that's a little bit more on our guidance, but again, we're looking -- really looking forward to Q4. I think we're well positioned to make it the best holiday ever for our customers. I think one day should help with holiday shipping. We've got a great new device line up you may have seen announced in September. And on the AWS side, we're looking forward to our re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, where we welcome over 65,000 conference attendees.

          Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Brian, just wanted to ask you kind of more broadly about Prime One-Day, what your biggest learnings have been so far over the past several months as you've been increasing availability. And then how should we think about that availability now when we get into the heart of the holiday season? And can you also just help us understand how that's playing into your operating income guidance for 4Q?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, sure. Let me start with the second part of that. So we're -- back in Q2, I said that we were estimating an $800 million expense in -- tied to one-day in Q2, and we actually were just above that in Q2.
In Q3, we expected that to grow. We've put it into our guidance, and we hit essentially where we expected on the guidance. So as we head into Q4, we've added what's just nearly $1.5 billion penalty in Q4 year-over-year for the cost of shipping, which is essentially transportation cost, the cost of expanding our transportation capacity, things like adding additional pulls in shifts in our warehouses, the cost of forward deploying inventory closer to customers. There's a lot of tangential costs. But by and away, the biggest expenses is on the actual transportation cost.
So we've built that into our Q4 guidance estimate. But we're very pleased with the customer response to one-day. You can see it in our revenue acceleration and also in our unit growth acceleration. Once again, the Ops team has really done yeoman's work here to create this capacity for us, and they continue to unlock additional capacity daily. We're expecting that it will be, again, a great help to customers in Q4. We have seen Prime members increase their orders, spend more, so they must also see it as a real help to them in their daily lives.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Youssef Houssaini Squali,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Brian, just a couple of quick ones. Of the 400 basis point sequential acceleration growth, can you help us just understand maybe how much of that was driven by Prime Day, which I think you guys said was a record day for you versus one-day shipping. Just trying to extract one versus the other because, obviously going into Q4, you're only going to have the latter.
And then on a lot of news around counterfeit and whatnot on the site, can you just help quantify that for us if there is a way for you to do that? And is the higher OpEx for Q4 also driven, at least in part, by the higher investment to combat that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, sure. So on the second one, I would say, the -- we're certainly very diligent on the -- trying to catch counterfeit products. I would put a lot of effort into that. We put a lot of human effort. We put a lot of machine learning and algorithmic effort into that as well. But I would say the bigger investments in Q4 are certainly twofold, one, around the AWS -- excuse me, the one-day shipping that I just mentioned. The other would be on AWS. We have -- we continue to invest in AWS. If you look at the progression of our operating margin in that business, we've reached a high of 31% last Q4 -- or excuse me, Q3. That was a time when we were -- as we mentioned at that time, it was very efficient. We had been banking some savings from forward investments in infrastructure in 2017. We continue to feel really good about not only the top line but also the bottom line in that business, but we are investing a lot more this year in sales force and marketing personnel mainly to handle a wider group of customers, a increasingly wide group of products. We continue to add thousands of new products and features a year, and we continue to expand geographically.
So the biggest impact that we saw in Q3 year-over-year in the AWS segment was tied to costs related to sales and marketing year-over-year and also, to secondary extent, infrastructure, which, if you look at our capital leases or equipment leases line, it grew 30% on trailing 12-month basis in Q3 of this year, and that was 9% last year. So there's been a step-up in infrastructure cost to support the higher usage demand. So we see those trends continuing into Q4, and that's essentially probably the other element of operating income year-over-year that's shorter than in prior quarters.

          Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have 2. Just to go back to the one-day cost, appreciate the color. Be curious to hear about how you think about what portion of these costs are sort of transitory versus structural. It sounds like there are some shipping costs in there. Can you just sort of talk to some of the steps you have to take over the next 1 to 2 years to get the one-day shipping cost closer to what

Olsavsky expressed excitement for the upcoming holiday season and mentioned the progress made on one-day shipping, which he believes will be a great additional service for customers in Q4.

Regarding revenue guidance for Q4, Olsavsky acknowledged that historically there has been a drop in the growth rate between Q3 and Q4. He attributed this drop to the law of large numbers and the difference in growth between the holiday season and the rest of the year. Olsavsky also mentioned two specific factors that may impact Q4 growth. First, the Diwali holiday in India, which was in Q4 last year, shifted partly to Q3 this year. Second, the increase in the consumption tax in Japan may have a slight negative impact on Q4 growth. Overall, Olsavsky expects these factors to have a more significant effect on international growth rather than the company as a whole.

One of the key topics discussed was the progress of Prime One-Day shipping. Olsavsky mentioned that the company had estimated an $800 million expense for one-day shipping in Q2, and they exceeded that expectation. In Q3, they expected further growth in expenses, and they hit their guidance. For Q4, they anticipate an additional $1.5 billion expense for the cost of transportation and expanding transportation capacity. However, Olsavsky emphasized that the customer response to one-day shipping has been positive, leading to revenue and unit growth acceleration.

The discussion also touched on investments in combating counterfeit products and the higher operating expenses for Q4. While Amazon is dedicated to detecting and preventing counterfeit products, the significant investments in Q4 are primarily focused on one-day shipping and the expansion of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Olsavsky mentioned that AWS has seen an increase in costs related to sales and marketing as well as infrastructure, driven by the addition of new products, expanding geographically, and growing sales force and marketing personnel.

Overall, despite potential headwinds in Q4, Amazon.com is optimistic about the holiday season and the impact of one-day shipping on customer experiences. They are confident in their ability to provide a great holiday season for customers and continue to invest in initiatives like AWS to support long-term growth.",gpt-3

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2020 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and spread of the pandemic; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and consumer spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.

Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before we move on to the Q&A, I'd like to lead off with a few comments. What we've all seen transpire in the past 2 months has been gut-wrenching and unprecedented. But it's also been a time of heroic action by health care workers, government officials, police and emergency personnel and all essential workers in our communities. This includes frontline Amazonians, including our Whole Foods team and our partners around the world. They've provided a lifeline of groceries and other critical supplies to the doorsteps of all of us at this critical time.
I'd like to give you some insight into what we have seen in Amazon and how we are responding to this crisis. Beginning in early March, we experienced a major surge in customer demand, particularly for household staples and other essential products across categories such as health and personal care, groceries and even home office supplies. At the same time, we saw lower demand for discretionary items such as apparel, shoes and wireless products. This large demand spike created major challenges in our operations network and with our seller community and our suppliers.
While we generally have experience in getting ready for spikes in demand for known events like the holiday season and Prime Day, we also generally spend months ramping up for these periods. The COVID crisis allowed for no such preparation. We took quick action to react to the higher order levels while continuing to provide for the safety of our workforce. We established rigorous safety and cleaning protocols, including maintaining 6-foot social distancing, procuring 100 million masks, tens of millions of gloves and wipes and other cleaning supplies. We began requiring temperature checks across our operations network.
In our Whole Food stores, we added plexiglass barriers between cashiers and customers and reserved special hours for senior customers to shop. We temporarily raised wages and overtime premiums, we funded a new Amazon relief fund and we allowed employees to take unpaid time off at their discretion. To deal with the unprecedented demand, we hired an additional 175,000 new employees, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy. We took steps to dampen demand for nonessential products, including reducing our marketing spend.
Our network pivoted to shipping priority of products within 1 to 4 days and extending promises on nonpriority items. Our independent third-party sellers, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses, worked tremendously hard to serve our customers, and we are grateful for their efforts. Third-party sellers continue to see strong growth in our stores as more than half of our units sold are from third-party sellers.
We increased grocery delivery capacity by more than 60% and expanded in-store pickup at Whole Food stores from over -- from 80 stores to more than 150 stores. And other Amazon teams shifted their focus to directly helping customers in the overall effort to fight the COVID virus.
AWS has created data lake to assist health care workers, researchers, scientists and public health officials who are working to understand and fight the coronavirus. Many of our AWS products are helping in the government response to the crisis and are there for customers who are seeing their own demand spikes, companies enabling videoconferencing, remote learning and online health services, for example.
Amazon Flex is supporting food banks by donating delivery services of groceries to serve 6 million meals in Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. with plans to ramp this up to 25 cities across the U.S. And Alexa is helping customers access important CDC guidance and help them evaluate their own COVID-19 risk levels.
How is all this impacting our business? While customer demand remains high, the incremental revenue we are seeing on many of the lower ASP essential products is basically coming at a cost. We've invested more than $600 million in COVID-related costs in Q1 and expect these costs could grow to $4 billion or more in Q2. These include productivity headwinds in our facilities as we provide for social distancing and allow for the ramp-up of new employees, investments in personal protective equipment for employees, enhanced cleaning of our facilities, higher wages for our hourly teams and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop COVID-19 testing capabilities. In Q1, we also had another $400 million of costs related to increased reserves for doubtful accounts. On the flip side, we did see a drop in travel, entertainment and meeting costs as well as lower marketing as a way to dampen our demand for nonessential items.
While we can't have great certainty about what the next few quarters will look like, I'm humbled by the efforts of my fellow Amazonians in delivering essential goods and services to so many people. We take this responsibility seriously, and we're proud of the work our teams are doing to help customers through this difficult time.
With that, let's open up for questions.

Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. First, I just wanted to ask, within the $4 billion of COVID-related incremental costs in 2Q, you talked about spending hundreds of millions on your own testing capabilities. Can you just talk about the strategic thinking there underlying, trying to build this in-house versus sourcing from elsewhere? And does this potentially take you into a new business path over time? And then how do you think about the spending here in 2Q and whether over time, does that change your margin structure for an extended period of time beyond just the next quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Sure, Doug. First, on testing. So we estimate the testing will be about $300 million in Q2 if we're successful. We've put some of our best people on it. I think everyone is trying to get testing. It's not readily available on the scale that we need it for -- to test our scale of employees. So we are working to do that ourselves and to build protocols and to -- and again, we'll see how we do that differently. And I don't know, again, about future business opportunities. Our main concern is getting testing in the hands of our employees. And then potentially as we have excess capacity, perhaps we can help in other areas. On the spending, the -- a lot of the costs that we're seeing are tied to this COVID response. Most of it is hitting in people costs, both in productivity and also in wages and relief funds and all. So we can't really tell how long that will last. It's probably good that I'm only giving -- we're only giving guidance for Q2 at this point. We're going to probably learn a lot more in the next few weeks, next few months, and we'll continue to update this. But for now, most of what we see are temporary costs in the scheme of things but certainly very expensive temporary costs and also ones that we're not sure how long that will last.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have 2, Brian. The first one is the current situation is sort of, I think, in many ways, sort of showcased the ability of your network to provide goods for people and the value of Prime and Amazon to customers. So I guess in light of that, can you talk to us at all about the impact you've seen on the Prime customer account from the current situation? Any color on how you've been able to expand Prime's reach into new customers or demographics from this? Then the second one, I know there's a lot of changes going on in logistics and things, but Amazon is always a learning company. So any learnings you've had so far on the logistics side about how you actually may be able to learn some new best practices to run more efficiently post-COVID from the current fire that we've been going through?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I think we have learned that it's easier to get ready for a holiday or for a Prime Day than it is to get ready for something like this when everything hits at once, high demand and then also a need to restock automatically and not prepare for it. So that's not something

Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019.\nOur comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.\nOur guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and spread of the pandemic; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and consumer spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBefore we move on to the Q&A, I'd like to lead off with a few comments. What we've all seen transpire in the past 2 months has been gut-wrenching and unprecedented. But it's also been a time of heroic action by health care workers, government officials, police and emergency personnel and all essential workers in our communities. This includes frontline Amazonians, including our Whole Foods team and our partners around the world. They've provided a lifeline of groceries and other critical supplies to the doorsteps of all of us at this critical time.\nI'd like to give you some insight into what we have seen in Amazon and how we are responding to this crisis. Beginning in early March, we experienced a major surge in customer demand, particularly for household staples and other essential products across categories such as health and personal care, groceries and even home office supplies. At the same time, we saw lower demand for discretionary items such as apparel, shoes and wireless products. This large demand spike created major challenges in our operations network and with our seller community and our suppliers.\nWhile we generally have experience in getting ready for spikes in demand for known events like the holiday season and Prime Day, we also generally spend months ramping up for these periods. The COVID crisis allowed for no such preparation. We took quick action to react to the higher order levels while continuing to provide for the safety of our workforce. We established rigorous safety and cleaning protocols, including maintaining 6-foot social distancing, procuring 100 million masks, tens of millions of gloves and wipes and other cleaning supplies. We began requiring temperature checks across our operations network.\nIn our Whole Food stores, we added plexiglass barriers between cashiers and customers and reserved special hours for senior customers to shop. We temporarily raised wages and overtime premiums, we funded a new Amazon relief fund and we allowed employees to take unpaid time off at their discretion. To deal with the unprecedented demand, we hired an additional 175,000 new employees, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy.

Olsavsky outlined the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company‚Äôs operations and finances, along with the accompanying changes in consumer demand patterns. Here are the key takeaways from the earnings call, organized into thematic groups:

**Demand and Sales Mix Changes:**
- There was a major surge in customer demand from early March, primarily for essential products like household staples, health and personal care, groceries, and home office supplies due to the pandemic.
- Demand for discretionary items such as apparel, shoes, and wireless products decreased.
- Despite high demand, revenue from essential products came at substantial costs due to the COVID-related operational changes.

**Operational and Safety Measures:**
- Amazon experienced operational challenges due to the sudden spike in demand, which was unlike the planned spikes seen during holidays or Prime Day.
- Amazon responded swiftly, implementing safety and cleaning protocols, including social distancing, procuring masks, gloves, increased cleaning, and conducting temperature checks in their operations network.
- Special hours were reserved for senior customers at Whole Foods, and plexiglass barriers were installed at checkout counters.
- Amazon hired an additional 175,000 employees due to increased demand and to compensate for labor disruptions across the economy.

**Cost Implications:**
- In response to the crisis, Amazon invested over $600 million in COVID-related costs in Q1 and anticipates these costs could grow to $4 billion or more in Q2.
- This estimate for Q2 includes around $300 million towards developing COVID-19 testing capabilities for employees, assuming successful implementation.
- Costs were also attributed to productivity headwinds, personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning, higher wages for hourly teams, and an Amazon relief fund.
- Reduced costs were noted in areas such as travel, entertainment, meetings, and marketing.

**Financial Considerations:**
- An additional $400 million was allocated for increased reserves for doubtful accounts in Q1.
- Consumer spending patterns and consumer demand are highly variable and inherently unpredictable under the current conditions.

**Forward Guidance and Business Outlook:**
- The guidance provided incorporates observed order trends and current assumptions deemed appropriate, including estimates of the pandemic's impact.
- The guidance for Q2 is subject to many variables, including fluctuating foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions, customer spending, world events, and the rate of growth of the internet and cloud services.
- It assumes no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements.
- Amazon acknowledges that their results could differ materially from the guidance due to the unpredictability of demand for their goods and services.

**Corporate Social Responsibility and Employee Welfare:**
- There was recognition of the efforts by frontline Amazon employees in delivering products and services.
- Wage increases and overtime premiums were temporarily raised, and employees were given the discretion for unpaid time off.

**Strategic Responses:**
- Amazon made attempts to dampen demand for nonessential products by reducing marketing efforts and adjusting their network to prioritize essential goods.
- Amazon's grocery delivery capacity was increased by more than 60%, and in-store pickup at Whole Foods was expanded.

**Support Beyond Amazon:**
- AWS launched a data lake to assist health care workers and public officials in fighting the virus.
- Amazon contributed delivery support to food banks and utilized Alexa to help customers access COVID-19 information.

Overall, the earnings call focused on detailing the unparalleled shift in business dynamics due to the COVID-19 pandemic, how Amazon is adapting to meet changed consumer needs, the substantial costs associated with these changes, and the challenges in providing forward guidance amidst volatility and uncertainty.",gpt-4

Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. First, I just wanted to ask, within the $4 billion of COVID-related incremental costs in 2Q, you talked about spending hundreds of millions on your own testing capabilities. Can you just talk about the strategic thinking there underlying, trying to build this in-house versus sourcing from elsewhere? And does this potentially take you into a new business path over time? And then how do you think about the spending here in 2Q and whether over time, does that change your margin structure for an extended period of time beyond just the next quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Sure, Doug. First, on testing. So we estimate the testing will be about $300 million in Q2 if we're successful. We've put some of our best people on it. I think everyone is trying to get testing. It's not readily available on the scale that we need it for -- to test our scale of employees. So we are working to do that ourselves and to build protocols and to -- and again, we'll see how we do that differently. And I don't know, again, about future business opportunities. Our main concern is getting testing in the hands of our employees. And then potentially as we have excess capacity, perhaps we can help in other areas. On the spending, the -- a lot of the costs that we're seeing are tied to this COVID response. Most of it is hitting in people costs, both in productivity and also in wages and relief funds and all. So we can't really tell how long that will last. It's probably good that I'm only giving -- we're only giving guidance for Q2 at this point. We're going to probably learn a lot more in the next few weeks, next few months, and we'll continue to update this. But for now, most of what we see are temporary costs in the scheme of things but certainly very expensive temporary costs and also ones that we're not sure how long that will last.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have 2, Brian. The first one is the current situation is sort of, I think, in many ways, sort of showcased the ability of your network to provide goods for people and the value of Prime and Amazon to customers. So I guess in light of that, can you talk to us at all about the impact you've seen on the Prime customer account from the current situation? Any color on how you've been able to expand Prime's reach into new customers or demographics from this? Then the second one, I know there's a lot of changes going on in logistics and things, but Amazon is always a learning company. So any learnings you've had so far on the logistics side about how you actually may be able to learn some new best practices to run more efficiently post-COVID from the current fire that we've been going through?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I think we have learned that it's easier to get ready for a holiday or for a Prime Day than it is to get ready for something like this when everything hits at once, high demand and then also a need to restock automatically and not prepare for it. So that's not something

Please go ahead.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nShelly Kay Pfeiffer,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHello, and welcome to our Q1 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019.\nOur comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.\nOur guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and spread of the pandemic; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and consumer spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBefore we move on to the Q&A, I'd like to lead off with a few comments. What we've all seen transpire in the past 2 months has been gut-wrenching and unprecedented. But it's also been a time of heroic action by health care workers, government officials, police and emergency personnel and all essential workers in our communities. This includes frontline Amazonians, including our Whole Foods team and our partners around the world. They've provided a lifeline of groceries and other critical supplies to the doorsteps of all of us at this critical time.\nI'd like to give you some insight into what we have seen in Amazon and how we are responding to this crisis. Beginning in early March, we experienced a major surge in customer demand, particularly for household staples and other essential products across categories such as health and personal care, groceries and even home office supplies. At the same time, we saw lower demand for discretionary items such as apparel, shoes and wireless products. This large demand spike created major challenges in our operations network and with our seller community and our suppliers.\nWhile we generally have experience in getting ready for spikes in demand for known events like the holiday season and Prime Day, we also generally spend months ramping up for these periods. The COVID crisis allowed for no such preparation. We took quick action to react to the higher order levels while continuing to provide for the safety of our workforce. We established rigorous safety and cleaning protocols, including maintaining 6-foot social distancing, procuring 100 million masks, tens of millions of gloves and wipes and other cleaning supplies. We began requiring temperature checks across our operations network.\nIn our Whole Food stores, we added plexiglass barriers between cashiers and customers and reserved special hours for senior customers to shop. We temporarily raised wages and overtime premiums, we funded a new Amazon relief fund and we allowed employees to take unpaid time off at their discretion. To deal with the unprecedented demand, we hired an additional 175,000 new employees, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy. We took steps to dampen demand for nonessential products, including reducing our marketing spend.\nOur network pivoted to shipping priority of products within 1 to 4 days and extending promises on nonpriority items. Our independent third-party sellers, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses, worked tremendously hard to serve our customers, and we are grateful for their efforts. Third-party sellers continue to see strong growth in our stores as more than half of our units sold are from third-party sellers.\nWe increased grocery delivery capacity by more than 60% and expanded in-store pickup at Whole Food stores from over -- from 80 stores to more than 150 stores. And other Amazon teams shifted their focus to directly helping customers in the overall effort to fight the COVID virus.\nAWS has created data lake to assist health care workers, researchers, scientists and public health officials who are working to understand and fight the coronavirus. Many of our AWS products are helping in the government response to the crisis and are there for customers who are seeing their own demand spikes, companies enabling videoconferencing, remote learning and online health services, for example.\nAmazon Flex is supporting food banks by donating delivery services of groceries to serve 6 million meals in Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. with plans to ramp this up to 25 cities across the U.S. And Alexa is helping customers access important CDC guidance and help them evaluate their own COVID-19 risk levels.\nHow is all this impacting our business? While customer demand remains high, the incremental revenue we are seeing on many of the lower ASP essential products is basically coming at a cost. We've invested more than $600 million in COVID-related costs in Q1 and expect these costs could grow to $4 billion or more in Q2. These include productivity headwinds in our facilities as we provide for social distancing and allow for the ramp-up of new employees, investments in personal protective equipment for employees, enhanced cleaning of our facilities, higher wages for our hourly teams and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop COVID-19 testing capabilities. In Q1, we also had another $400 million of costs related to increased reserves for doubtful accounts. On the flip side, we did see a drop in travel, entertainment and meeting costs as well as lower marketing as a way to dampen our demand for nonessential items.\nWhile we can't have great certainty about what the next few quarters will look like, I'm humbled by the efforts of my fellow Amazonians in delivering essential goods and services to so many people. We take this responsibility seriously, and we're proud of the work our teams are doing to help customers through this difficult time.\nWith that, let's open up for questions.\n\n\n================================================================================\nQuestions and Answers\n================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDouglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGreat.

So that's not something ""}","Key Insights from the Earnings Call Transcript:

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Thank you. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 25, 2019, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. I'm going to ask 2 questions because the first one is really simple. Unit growth of 10%, is this a meaningless metric? Just talk through that number. I think it's the lowest unit growth I think we've ever seen, but just talk through us a little bit about that. And then international sales growth decelerated 16%. I know last -- ex FX, I know last quarter, you talked about some challenges in the India market. Just give us some color, please, around that growth rate. How do we think about the sustainability of that? Was that negatively impacted by developments in India?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. I'll start on unit growth. So unit growth was 10%. Again, as I mentioned last quarter, it is measurement, excludes a lot of our fastest growing businesses, things like AWS, advertising, subscription services which cannibalize the unit calculations, things like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited. And also, it doesn't include Whole Foods Market. So while it is meaningful, it needs to be understood and caveated.
So your second question was on international growth. Yes, talking more about specifically India, so India, for those of you on the call last quarter, we are just heading into an uncertain period with the PN2 ruling. We did make some changes to our structure to stay in compliance with all regulations. There was a few days of downtime for some of our selection. But for the full quarter, the impact was minimal. And we're in compliance, and we're very happy with the progress of the business in India. So as far as the growth is concerned in international, we had some noise in Q3 and Q4, if you remember, with the timing of the Diwali holiday, but we feel pretty good about the Q1 growth there even despite some downtime in India.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I'll also ask 2, if I can. Just first, Brian, can you just talk about the outperformance in operating income in 1Q, pretty significant there? It looks like local sales and booking and so hoping you can provide some more color. And then why would the margin be materially lower in Q2 as you're guiding? And then just second, on the outlook for revenue in the second quarter on an FX-neutral basis, the higher end implies a nice acceleration. So curious what gives you the confidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Doug. Yes, let's start with Q1. So if you remember last quarter, I made the point that 2018 saw lower growth in some of our key cost areas. Things like fulfillment capacity, which have been growing over 30% a year in 2016 and '17, dropped to 15% last year. Headcount growth was 48% in 2016, 38% if you exclude Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions in 2017. That dropped to 14% last year. And then financial leases for infrastructure, which are good proxy for capital investment and infrastructure, after growing 69% in 2017, grew 10%. So all of those trailing 12-month metrics actually stayed the same or slightly declined in Q1. So we had continued efficiency. We didn't put a lot of new fulfillment center capacity or infrastructure into place at least compared to Q1 of last year. And hiring was moderate. We actually are down to 12% on a trailing 12-month basis. So I would say that is a continuation of last year, but my point from the last call still holds in that we do expect those growth rates to be higher for all of 2019. So most of that will happen in the next 3 quarters, and we have that built into the Q2 guidance. We also hit the high end of the revenue range, which is always good from efficiency standpoint and the drop-through on the higher end of the revenue.
So now turning into Q2, I would like to tell you a bit about why that's lower. So we have -- we're currently working on evolving our Prime free 2-day shipping program to be a free 1-day shipping program. We're able to do this because we spent 20-plus years expanding our fulfillment and logistics network, but this is still a big investment and a lot of work to do ahead of us. For Q2 guidance, we've included approximately $800 million of incremental spend related to this investment. And just to clarify, to give a little more information, we have been offering, obviously, faster than 2-day shipping for Prime members for years, 1 day, same day, even down to 1- to 2-hour delivery for Prime Now. So we're going to continue to do -- to offer same-day and Prime Now selection on an accelerated basis. But this is all about the core free 2-day offer morphing into -- or evolving into a free 1-day offer. We've already started down this path. We've, in the past months, significantly expanded our 1-day eligible selection and also expanded the number of zip codes eligible for 1-day shipping. So we're taking a significant step. It wasn't showing up in Q1. It was minimal in Q2 -- in Q1's results. This is a significant step and it will take us time to achieve and we want to ensure that we have good delivery experience for our customers as we evolve the software.
And lastly, I would say in Q2, as a reminder, each year, we -- it's -- Q2 is a time when we grant RSUs to employees and we traditionally see a step-up in stock-based compensation expense in Q2. We're seeing the same thing this year. And that's -- sorry, and that's also tied in with your question about revenue acceleration. We do believe that although there's not explicit lift built in for the faster shipping, we have seen good order trends to -- month to date and we expect -- we built the Q2 range about -- around what we've seen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question is from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          As users consume more services and maybe get less boxes, although I guess you could see a pickup in Q2, what does that mean for customer stickiness? How are you thinking about getting more advertising and getting more subscription services? And maybe you could just give us a little insight into what you're seeing with Prime churn especially in the more mature U.S. market.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Sure. Justin, I would say, as I said, I believe, on the last call, we had more people sign up for Prime in 2018 than any other year before. So we are very happy with the -- not only the absolute membership levels of the Prime program, but also the engagement. Our engagement in video benefit -- or excuse me, Prime benefits, shipping, hours watched on video, hours listened to on music, all of them are trending in the right direction and continue to get more and more sticky. So while I can't share -- I wouldn't share with you today the Prime -- any Prime -- specific Prime statistics about churn, it does remain a very compelling program. I think the announcement I just made about morphing to a 1-day free shipping offer will make it even more the best deal in retail as we say.

          Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.

Eric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The advertising business saw what looks like a little bit of a step-down again in Q1 versus Q4. Q4 was a fairly big step-down when you strip out the accounting benefit over the last quarter -- the accounting benefit. Can you talk a little bit about the supply and demand dynamics in the advertising business? How much of that will you might be controlling to making decisions about ad load versus the demand to advertise among sellers on the platform? And any color you could give us on what you might be seeing in the advertising business domestically versus internationally would be helpful.

Please go ahead.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nShelly Kay Pfeiffer,   -     [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations.\nAs you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.\nPlease note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 25, 2019, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.\nOur guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.\nWith that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\n\n\n================================================================================\nQuestions and Answers\n================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Okay. I'm going to ask 2 questions because the first one is really simple. Unit growth of 10%, is this a meaningless metric? Just talk through that number. I think it's the lowest unit growth I think we've ever seen, but just talk through us a little bit about that. And then international sales growth decelerated 16%. I know last -- ex FX, I know last quarter, you talked about some challenges in the India market. Just give us some color, please, around that growth rate. How do we think about the sustainability of that? Was that negatively impacted by developments in India?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. I'll start on unit growth. So unit growth was 10%. Again, as I mentioned last quarter, it is measurement, excludes a lot of our fastest growing businesses, things like AWS, advertising, subscription services which cannibalize the unit calculations, things like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited. And also, it doesn't include Whole Foods Market. So while it is meaningful, it needs to be understood and caveated.\nSo your second question was on international growth. Yes, talking more about specifically India, so India, for those of you on the call last quarter, we are just heading into an uncertain period with the PN2 ruling. We did make some changes to our structure to stay in compliance with all regulations. There was a few days of downtime for some of our selection. But for the full quarter, the impact was minimal. And we're in compliance, and we're very happy with the progress of the business in India. So as far as the growth is concerned in international, we had some noise in Q3 and Q4, if you remember, with the timing of the Diwali holiday, but we feel pretty good about the Q1 growth there even despite some downtime in India.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDouglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          I'll also ask 2, if I can. Just first, Brian, can you just talk about the outperformance in operating income in 1Q, pretty significant there? It looks like local sales and booking and so hoping you can provide some more color. And then why would the margin be materially lower in Q2 as you're guiding? And then just second, on the outlook for revenue in the second quarter on an FX-neutral basis, the higher end implies a nice acceleration. So curious what gives you the confidence.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure, Doug. Yes, let's start with Q1. So if you remember last quarter, I made the point that 2018 saw lower growth in some of our key cost areas. Things like fulfillment capacity, which have been growing over 30% a year in 2016 and '17, dropped to 15% last year. Headcount growth was 48% in 2016, 38% if you exclude Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions in 2017. That dropped to 14% last year. And then financial leases for infrastructure, which are good proxy for capital investment and infrastructure, after growing 69% in 2017, grew 10%. So all of those trailing 12-month metrics actually stayed the same or slightly declined in Q1. So we had continued efficiency. We didn't put a lot of new fulfillment center capacity or infrastructure into place at least compared to Q1 of last year. And hiring was moderate. We actually are down to 12% on a trailing 12-month basis. So I would say that is a continuation of last year, but my point from the last call still holds in that we do expect those growth rates to be higher for all of 2019. So most of that will happen in the next 3 quarters, and we have that built into the Q2 guidance. We also hit the high end of the revenue range, which is always good from efficiency standpoint and the drop-through on the higher end of the revenue.\nSo now turning into Q2, I would like to tell you a bit about why that's lower. So we have -- we're currently working on evolving our Prime free 2-day shipping program to be a free 1-day shipping program. We're able to do this because we spent 20-plus years expanding our fulfillment and logistics network, but this is still a big investment and a lot of work to do ahead of us. For Q2 guidance, we've included approximately $800 million of incremental spend related to this investment. And just to clarify, to give a little more information, we have been offering, obviously, faster than 2-day shipping for Prime members for years, 1 day, same day, even down to 1- to 2-hour delivery for Prime Now. So we're going to continue to do -- to offer same-day and Prime Now selection on an accelerated basis. But this is all about the core free 2-day offer morphing into -- or evolving into a free 1-day offer. We've already started down this path. We've, in the past months, significantly expanded our 1-day eligible selection and also expanded the number of zip codes eligible for 1-day shipping. So we're taking a significant step. It wasn't showing up in Q1. It was minimal in Q2 -- in Q1's results. This is a significant step and it will take us time to achieve and we want to ensure that we have good delivery experience for our customers as we evolve the software.\nAnd lastly, I would say in Q2, as a reminder, each year, we -- it's -- Q2 is a time when we grant RSUs to employees and we traditionally see a step-up in stock-based compensation expense in Q2. We're seeing the same thing this year. And that's -- sorry, and that's also tied in with your question about revenue acceleration. We do believe that although there's not explicit lift built in for the faster shipping, we have seen good order trends to -- month to date and we expect -- we built the Q2 range about -- around what we've seen.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question is from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJustin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          As users consume more services and maybe get less boxes, although I guess you could see a pickup in Q2, what does that mean for customer stickiness? How are you thinking about getting more advertising and getting more subscription services? And maybe you could just give us a little insight into what you're seeing with Prime churn especially in the more mature U.S. market.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Yes. Sure. Justin, I would say, as I said, I believe, on the last call, we had more people sign up for Prime in 2018 than any other year before. So we are very happy with the -- not only the absolute membership levels of the Prime program, but also the engagement. Our engagement in video benefit -- or excuse me, Prime benefits, shipping, hours watched on video, hours listened to on music, all of them are trending in the right direction and continue to get more and more sticky. So while I can't share -- I wouldn't share with you today the Prime -- any Prime -- specific Prime statistics about churn, it does remain a very compelling program. I think the announcement I just made about morphing to a 1-day free shipping offer will make it even more the best deal in retail as we say.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          The advertising business saw what looks like a little bit of a step-down again in Q1 versus Q4.

Can you talk a little bit about the supply and demand dynamics in the advertising business? How much of that will you might be controlling to making decisions about ad load versus the demand to advertise among sellers on the platform? And any color you could give us on what you might be seeing in the advertising business domestically versus internationally would be helpful.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------""}","Based on the earnings call transcript for Q1 2019 of Amazon.com Inc., the company has highlighted the following key insights across various aspects of its performance and strategic outlook.

Unit Growth and Revenue Trends:
- Unit growth was reported at 10%, which is the lowest the company has seen. This metric excludes significant segments like AWS, advertising, subscription services, and Whole Foods Market. The indication was that this metric, while still meaningful, should be interpreted with these caveats in mind.
- International sales growth decelerated to 16% (excluding foreign exchange impacts), with commentary specifically addressing challenges in the India market due to regulatory changes (PN2 ruling). The company adjusted its business structure to maintain compliance, which resulted in minimal selection downtime and minimal impact on the quarter‚Äôs results. Amazon views the growth rate positively despite these challenges.

Operating Income and Efficiency:
- Amazon reported a significant outperformance in operating income for Q1. This was linked to efficiency stemming from lower growth in some key cost areas year-over-year, such as fulfillment capacity, headcount growth, and infrastructure-related capital leases.
- The company expects these growth rates in cost areas to increase over the next three quarters. This returned growth is factored into Q2 guidance.

Prime Membership and Shipping:
- Prime membership and engagement are on an upward trajectory, with more Prime subscriptions in 2018 than any previous year and increased use of Prime benefits like video and music.
- Amazon is transitioning its Prime free two-day shipping to a free one-day shipping program. Approximately $800 million of incremental spend related to this investment is included in Q2 guidance.

Advertising Business:
- The advertising business saw a step-down in growth Q1, continuing from Q4. The discussion addressed the balance Amazon is managing between advertising supply and demand, hinting at potential decisions around ad load but did not delve into detailed supply and demand dynamics.
- No specific insights were provided regarding domestic versus international performance in the advertising segment.

Guidance and Projections:
- The Q2 revenue projection is optimistic, predicting acceleration even without explicit projections for the impact of improved shipping. This outlook is based on current order trends and assumptions.
- Operating margin is expected to be materially lower in Q2 due to the investment in transitioning to one-day Prime shipping and traditionally higher stock-based compensation expenses in Q2.

Macroeconomic and Miscellaneous:
- Amazon‚Äôs results may be influenced by several unpredictable factors, including foreign exchange fluctuations, global economic conditions, customer spending, online commerce and cloud services growth, and other detailed factors in SEC filings.
- The company‚Äôs guidance assumes no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements for Q2.

The above synthesis aims to report the specific data points and discussions from the transcript without generalizing, speculating, or providing an overall assessment.",gpt-4

Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [2]

          Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I'll also ask 2, if I can. Just first, Brian, can you just talk about the outperformance in operating income in 1Q, pretty significant there? It looks like local sales and booking and so hoping you can provide some more color. And then why would the margin be materially lower in Q2 as you're guiding? And then just second, on the outlook for revenue in the second quarter on an FX-neutral basis, the higher end implies a nice acceleration. So curious what gives you the confidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Doug. Yes, let's start with Q1. So if you remember last quarter, I made the point that 2018 saw lower growth in some of our key cost areas. Things like fulfillment capacity, which have been growing over 30% a year in 2016 and '17, dropped to 15% last year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question is from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          As users consume more services and maybe get less boxes, although I guess you could see a pickup in Q2, what does that mean for customer stickiness? How are you thinking about getting more advertising and getting more subscription services? And maybe you could just give us a little insight into what you're seeing with Prime churn especially in the more mature U.S. market.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Sure. Justin, I would say, as I said, I believe, on the last call, we had more people sign up for Prime in 2018 than any other year before. So we are very happy with the -- not only the absolute membership levels of the Prime program, but also the engagement.

          Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The advertising business saw what looks like a little bit of a step-down again in Q1 versus Q4. Q4 was a fairly big step-down when you strip out the accounting benefit over the last quarter -- the accounting benefit. Can you talk a little bit about the supply and demand dynamics in the advertising business? How much of that will you might be controlling to making decisions about ad load versus the demand to advertise among sellers on the platform? And any color you could give us on what you might be seeing in the advertising business domestically versus internationally would be helpful.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nShelly Kay Pfeiffer,   -     [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations.\nAs you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.\nPlease note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 25, 2019, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.\nOur guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.\nWith that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\n\n\n================================================================================\nQuestions and Answers\n================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Okay. I'm going to ask 2 questions because the first one is really simple. Unit growth of 10%, is this a meaningless metric? Just talk through that number. I think it's the lowest unit growth I think we've ever seen, but just talk through us a little bit about that. And then international sales growth decelerated 16%. I know last -- ex FX, I know last quarter, you talked about some challenges in the India market. Just give us some color, please, around that growth rate. How do we think about the sustainability of that? Was that negatively impacted by developments in India?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. I'll start on unit growth. So unit growth was 10%. Again, as I mentioned last quarter, it is measurement, excludes a lot of our fastest growing businesses, things like AWS, advertising, subscription services which cannibalize the unit calculations, things like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited. And also, it doesn't include Whole Foods Market. So while it is meaningful, it needs to be understood and caveated.\nSo your second question was on international growth. Yes, talking more about specifically India, so India, for those of you on the call last quarter, we are just heading into an uncertain period with the PN2 ruling. We did make some changes to our structure to stay in compliance with all regulations. There was a few days of downtime for some of our selection. But for the full quarter, the impact was minimal. And we're in compliance, and we're very happy with the progress of the business in India. So as far as the growth is concerned in international, we had some noise in Q3 and Q4, if you remember, with the timing of the Diwali holiday, but we feel pretty good about the Q1 growth there even despite some downtime in India.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDouglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          I'll also ask 2, if I can. Just first, Brian, can you just talk about the outperformance in operating income in 1Q, pretty significant there? It looks like local sales and booking and so hoping you can provide some more color. And then why would the margin be materially lower in Q2 as you're guiding? And then just second, on the outlook for revenue in the second quarter on an FX-neutral basis, the higher end implies a nice acceleration. So curious what gives you the confidence.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure, Doug. Yes, let's start with Q1. So if you remember last quarter, I made the point that 2018 saw lower growth in some of our key cost areas. Things like fulfillment capacity, which have been growing over 30% a year in 2016 and '17, dropped to 15% last year. Headcount growth was 48% in 2016, 38% if you exclude Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions in 2017. That dropped to 14% last year. And then financial leases for infrastructure, which are good proxy for capital investment and infrastructure, after growing 69% in 2017, grew 10%. So all of those trailing 12-month metrics actually stayed the same or slightly declined in Q1. So we had continued efficiency. We didn't put a lot of new fulfillment center capacity or infrastructure into place at least compared to Q1 of last year. And hiring was moderate. We actually are down to 12% on a trailing 12-month basis. So I would say that is a continuation of last year, but my point from the last call still holds in that we do expect those growth rates to be higher for all of 2019. So most of that will happen in the next 3 quarters, and we have that built into the Q2 guidance. We also hit the high end of the revenue range, which is always good from efficiency standpoint and the drop-through on the higher end of the revenue.\nSo now turning into Q2, I would like to tell you a bit about why that's lower. So we have -- we're currently working on evolving our Prime free 2-day shipping program to be a free 1-day shipping program. We're able to do this because we spent 20-plus years expanding our fulfillment and logistics network, but this is still a big investment and a lot of work to do ahead of us. For Q2 guidance, we've included approximately $800 million of incremental spend related to this investment. And just to clarify, to give a little more information, we have been offering, obviously, faster than 2-day shipping for Prime members for years, 1 day, same day, even down to 1- to 2-hour delivery for Prime Now. So we're going to continue to do -- to offer same-day and Prime Now selection on an accelerated basis. But this is all about the core free 2-day offer morphing into -- or evolving into a free 1-day offer. We've already started down this path. We've, in the past months, significantly expanded our 1-day eligible selection and also expanded the number of zip codes eligible for 1-day shipping. So we're taking a significant step. It wasn't showing up in Q1. It was minimal in Q2 -- in Q1's results. This is a significant step and it will take us time to achieve and we want to ensure that we have good delivery experience for our customers as we evolve the software.\nAnd lastly, I would say in Q2, as a reminder, each year, we -- it's -- Q2 is a time when we grant RSUs to employees and we traditionally see a step-up in stock-based compensation expense in Q2. We're seeing the same thing this year. And that's -- sorry, and that's also tied in with your question about revenue acceleration. We do believe that although there's not explicit lift built in for the faster shipping, we have seen good order trends to -- month to date and we expect -- we built the Q2 range about -- around what we've seen.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question is from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJustin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          As users consume more services and maybe get less boxes, although I guess you could see a pickup in Q2, what does that mean for customer stickiness? How are you thinking about getting more advertising and getting more subscription services? And maybe you could just give us a little insight into what you're seeing with Prime churn especially in the more mature U.S. market.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Yes. Sure. Justin, I would say, as I said, I believe, on the last call, we had more people sign up for Prime in 2018 than any other year before. So we are very happy with the -- not only the absolute membership levels of the Prime program, but also the engagement. Our engagement in video benefit -- or excuse me, Prime benefits, shipping, hours watched on video, hours listened to on music, all of them are trending in the right direction and continue to get more and more sticky. So while I can't share -- I wouldn't share with you today the Prime -- any Prime -- specific Prime statistics about churn, it does remain a very compelling program. I think the announcement I just made about morphing to a 1-day free shipping offer will make it even more the best deal in retail as we say.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          The advertising business saw what looks like a little bit of a step-down again in Q1 versus Q4. Q4 was a fairly big step-down when you strip out the accounting benefit over the last quarter -- the accounting benefit. Can you talk a little bit about the supply and demand dynamics in the advertising business? How much of that will you might be controlling to making decisions about ad load versus the demand to advertise among sellers on the platform? And any color you could give us on what you might be seeing in the advertising business domestically versus internationally would be helpful.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------""}","Key Insights from the Amazon.com Q1 2019 Earnings Call:

1. Unit growth: Amazon reported a 10% unit growth rate, which excludes their fastest-growing businesses like AWS, advertising, and subscription services. It does not include Whole Foods Market either. While this metric is meaningful, it needs to be understood in the context of the excluded businesses.

2. International growth: The growth rate of international sales decelerated to 16%, largely due to the uncertainties surrounding the PN2 ruling in India. Amazon made some structural changes to comply with regulations, resulting in a few days of downtime for some selection. However, overall impact on Q1 was minimal, and they are happy with the progress of their business in India.

3. Operating income outperformance: Amazon saw significant outperformance in operating income in Q1. This was attributed to continued efficiency, as key cost areas like fulfillment capacity, headcount growth, and financial leases for infrastructure remained stable or declined compared to the previous year.

4. Margin outlook for Q2: Amazon expects its margin to be materially lower in Q2 due to a significant investment in evolving its Prime free 2-day shipping program into a free 1-day shipping program. This investment, which includes approximately $800 million of incremental spending, will require time to achieve and ensure a good delivery experience for customers.

5. Revenue outlook for Q2: Amazon's guidance for Q2 on an FX-neutral basis implies a nice acceleration. While there was no explicit lift built in for faster shipping, they have seen good order trends so far in Q2, which gives them confidence in the revenue acceleration.

6. Customer stickiness: Amazon's Prime program continues to be compelling, with more people signing up in 2018 than any other year before. The engagement level with Prime benefits such as shipping, video, and music is trending in the right direction and becoming more sticky.

7. Advertising business dynamics: Amazon's advertising business saw a step-down in Q1 compared to Q4, excluding the accounting benefit. The company attributes this to supply and demand dynamics, where they make decisions about ad load based on the demand to advertise among sellers on their platform. While specific details on the domestic versus international performance were not provided, the advertising business remains an important growth driver.

In summary, Amazon reported strong operating income outperformance in Q1, but expects lower margin in Q2 due to investments in evolving their Prime shipping program. Their advertising business saw some moderation, and international growth was affected by uncertainties in the India market. Overall, they remain confident in their revenue acceleration and the stickiness of their Prime program.",gpt-3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 27, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and excludes the impact of our proposed acquisition of Whole Foods Market. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heath P. Terry,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I was just wondering if you could give us a sense on the investments that are planned in Q3. Previously, you've been willing to provide sort of some qualitative guidance around how you're rank ordering those in terms of the ones that are -- the largest areas of investment in the quarter. Just wondering if you could update us on that just given the guidance for Q3 and what we saw in investment in Q2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Let me see what I can tell you on that. First of all, I want to remind you that Q3 is typically a lower operating income quarter as we're preparing for the Q4 holiday peak. The other dynamic is that similar to last year, a large percentage of our new fulfillment centers are coming online in the second half of the year, a lot of them in Q3. So to give that some perspective, the Amazon-Fulfilled Network or the combination of retail and FBA shipments coming out of our warehouses has been nearly 40%. It was that last year and it's continued through this year. Last year, we added 30% additional square footage to handle that additional shipping volume, and about 80% of that went in to service in the back end of last year. That's what I mentioned about this time last year. The -- similar dynamic this year. We're going to have about 80% of our increase in square footage for fulfillment and shipping coming online in the back end of the year. So that's a major increase. The other comment I would make is on the content -- video content. Video content, last year I highlighted the fact that it was going to be a significant step up between first half -- second half of 2016 and the second half of 2015. We are still -- we lapped that most of the first half of this year, and we'll also be increasing video spend on a sequential and year-over-year basis in Q3 and that's included in this guidance. Other than that, I can't give much more specifics except to say that the large investment areas remain increasing fulfillment capacity to service the strong growth of the FBA business. I'll also point out that the strong usage growth at AWS has led us to a step up in infrastructure in the form of capital leases. We've built capital leases in the trailing 12 months. They've increased 71% through the end of Q2 versus last year. That is servicing -- accelerating usage in our largest AWS services as well as geographic expansion. So that's additional factor sequentially in the quarter year-over-year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Alan Sebastian,  Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          A question on the grocery category and the announcement that we have -- that we heard recently. Specifically, does that imply that the strategy has changed around Fresh, which was presumably replacing the trip to the grocery store? Or should we think about adding different modes, such as pickup points and bricks-and-mortar, as serving a distinct customer base or geared to reduce the cost bottleneck around home delivery? Any comments would be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Colin. First, as far as Whole Foods is concerned, as Darin mentioned, it's not included in this guidance since it hasn't closed yet, but we are excited about that acquisition and looking forward to working with the team at Whole Foods. We think they're very customer-centric just like us. They've built a great business focused around quality and customers. So we're really glad to join up with them. On your larger question about with the place of AmazonFresh, that include Prime Now and some of our other efforts, I would say we believe there will be no one solution. So we're experimenting with a number of the formats, from physical pickup points in Amazon Go to online ordering and delivery to your door through Prime Now and AmazonFresh. And we'll see how customers respond. We like the response that we've seen so far. We think they're valuable. All those are valuable services. Amazon Go is not out of beta, but the other ones are. On top of that, we're looking forward to adding the Whole Foods team and their great reputation for quality and customer service to this offering.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          A couple of questions. It definitely seems relative to your guidance, you may have stepped up spending in the second quarter. Anything in particular to call out, India or anything like that? And then just thinking bigger picture, I'm wondering why physical locations might make sense for Amazon. Why is that a positive use of capital going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. As far as Q2 is concerned, we were very encouraged by the revenue and unit growth acceleration, particularly in North America. We see that as tied to the Prime growth and the adoption of Prime and success of that program. Also point out that AWS stepped up its run rate from a $14 billion run rate last quarter to $16 billion. So we saw the largest quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increase in revenue in that businesses as well, and gross margin expanded 130 basis points. So as you point out, the year-over-year difference is primarily driven by investments. The -- we're within the guidance range, and we continue to invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistic services, digital video, our Echo and Alexa -- Echo devices and Alexa platform, India, the buildup at AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned, not to mention Prime Now and AmazonFresh and Prime benefits. We did see a big jump in headcount in year-over-year. You'll see it's 42%, and in the past I've said most of that is driven by operations hiring. And I've even said that headquarters office hiring many times in the past was below the level of revenue growth. Right now what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising. So yes, those -- the growth rate of those 2 job categories actually exceeded the company growth rates. So we are adding -- having success hiring a lot of people and pointing them at some very important programs and customer-facing efforts. On the place of physical, again, as I mentioned in the earlier question, we are experimenting with a number of formats. You've seen the physical bookstores, and I would say that the benefit there is -- again, we have a curated selection of titles and it's also a great opportunity for people to touch and feel our devices and see them, especially the new Echo devices. I went into the store in Seattle last week and I saw about 1/3 of the people were standing around the device table, learning how they work, how they interact with the devices. So I saw firsthand the customer experience. I think that's where we're seeing the benefit to the physical stores right now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Alan May,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Question on the comments around the fulfillment investments. Could you characterize or maybe even quantify how much of the fulfillment infrastructure investment that you're making is going to incrementally gear towards handling growth in sort of the existing business and infrastructure versus expanding your capabilities in fulfillment, like adding more inbound or last mile and/or from entering new international markets where you need to invest ahead of growth versus just sort of keeping up and maintaining growth within sort of your existing footprint? And then AWS, you had some price adjustments in May, yet the Q2 growth was quite good. Can you just comment about the impact that those cuts may have had in Q2? And if you're modeling those also in your Q3 guidance, maybe the impact there.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.

Please go ahead.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDarin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Head of IR    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.\nAs you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016.\nOur comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 27, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.\nOur guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and excludes the impact of our proposed acquisition of Whole Foods Market. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.\nWith that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\n\n\n================================================================================\nQuestions and Answers\n================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHeath P. Terry,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          I was just wondering if you could give us a sense on the investments that are planned in Q3. Previously, you've been willing to provide sort of some qualitative guidance around how you're rank ordering those in terms of the ones that are -- the largest areas of investment in the quarter. Just wondering if you could update us on that just given the guidance for Q3 and what we saw in investment in Q2.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. Let me see what I can tell you on that. First of all, I want to remind you that Q3 is typically a lower operating income quarter as we're preparing for the Q4 holiday peak. The other dynamic is that similar to last year, a large percentage of our new fulfillment centers are coming online in the second half of the year, a lot of them in Q3. So to give that some perspective, the Amazon-Fulfilled Network or the combination of retail and FBA shipments coming out of our warehouses has been nearly 40%. It was that last year and it's continued through this year. Last year, we added 30% additional square footage to handle that additional shipping volume, and about 80% of that went in to service in the back end of last year. That's what I mentioned about this time last year. The -- similar dynamic this year. We're going to have about 80% of our increase in square footage for fulfillment and shipping coming online in the back end of the year. So that's a major increase. The other comment I would make is on the content -- video content. Video content, last year I highlighted the fact that it was going to be a significant step up between first half -- second half of 2016 and the second half of 2015. We are still -- we lapped that most of the first half of this year, and we'll also be increasing video spend on a sequential and year-over-year basis in Q3 and that's included in this guidance. Other than that, I can't give much more specifics except to say that the large investment areas remain increasing fulfillment capacity to service the strong growth of the FBA business. I'll also point out that the strong usage growth at AWS has led us to a step up in infrastructure in the form of capital leases. We've built capital leases in the trailing 12 months. They've increased 71% through the end of Q2 versus last year. That is servicing -- accelerating usage in our largest AWS services as well as geographic expansion. So that's additional factor sequentially in the quarter year-over-year.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nColin Alan Sebastian,  Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          A question on the grocery category and the announcement that we have -- that we heard recently. Specifically, does that imply that the strategy has changed around Fresh, which was presumably replacing the trip to the grocery store? Or should we think about adding different modes, such as pickup points and bricks-and-mortar, as serving a distinct customer base or geared to reduce the cost bottleneck around home delivery? Any comments would be helpful.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure, Colin. First, as far as Whole Foods is concerned, as Darin mentioned, it's not included in this guidance since it hasn't closed yet, but we are excited about that acquisition and looking forward to working with the team at Whole Foods. We think they're very customer-centric just like us. They've built a great business focused around quality and customers. So we're really glad to join up with them. On your larger question about with the place of AmazonFresh, that include Prime Now and some of our other efforts, I would say we believe there will be no one solution. So we're experimenting with a number of the formats, from physical pickup points in Amazon Go to online ordering and delivery to your door through Prime Now and AmazonFresh. And we'll see how customers respond. We like the response that we've seen so far. We think they're valuable. All those are valuable services. Amazon Go is not out of beta, but the other ones are. On top of that, we're looking forward to adding the Whole Foods team and their great reputation for quality and customer service to this offering.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJustin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          A couple of questions. It definitely seems relative to your guidance, you may have stepped up spending in the second quarter. Anything in particular to call out, India or anything like that? And then just thinking bigger picture, I'm wondering why physical locations might make sense for Amazon. Why is that a positive use of capital going forward?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. As far as Q2 is concerned, we were very encouraged by the revenue and unit growth acceleration, particularly in North America. We see that as tied to the Prime growth and the adoption of Prime and success of that program. Also point out that AWS stepped up its run rate from a $14 billion run rate last quarter to $16 billion. So we saw the largest quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increase in revenue in that businesses as well, and gross margin expanded 130 basis points. So as you point out, the year-over-year difference is primarily driven by investments. The -- we're within the guidance range, and we continue to invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistic services, digital video, our Echo and Alexa -- Echo devices and Alexa platform, India, the buildup at AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned, not to mention Prime Now and AmazonFresh and Prime benefits. We did see a big jump in headcount in year-over-year. You'll see it's 42%, and in the past I've said most of that is driven by operations hiring. And I've even said that headquarters office hiring many times in the past was below the level of revenue growth. Right now what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising. So yes, those -- the growth rate of those 2 job categories actually exceeded the company growth rates. So we are adding -- having success hiring a lot of people and pointing them at some very important programs and customer-facing efforts. On the place of physical, again, as I mentioned in the earlier question, we are experimenting with a number of formats. You've seen the physical bookstores, and I would say that the benefit there is -- again, we have a curated selection of titles and it's also a great opportunity for people to touch and feel our devices and see them, especially the new Echo devices. I went into the store in Seattle last week and I saw about 1/3 of the people were standing around the device table, learning how they work, how they interact with the devices. So I saw firsthand the customer experience. I think that's where we're seeing the benefit to the physical stores right now.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Alan May,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Question on the comments around the fulfillment investments. Could you characterize or maybe even quantify how much of the fulfillment infrastructure investment that you're making is going to incrementally gear towards handling growth in sort of the existing business and infrastructure versus expanding your capabilities in fulfillment, like adding more inbound or last mile and/or from entering new international markets where you need to invest ahead of growth versus just sort of keeping up and maintaining growth within sort of your existing footprint? And then AWS, you had some price adjustments in May, yet the Q2 growth was quite good. Can you just comment about the impact that those cuts may have had in Q2? And if you're modeling those also in your Q3 guidance, maybe the impact there.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nB""}","**Investment and Spending**

- **Fulfillment Expansion**: Amazon reported a significant year-over-year increase in investments mainly directed towards expanding fulfillment and logistic services to accommodate the growing volumes of FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) shipments. A notable 40% of retail and FBA shipments have been managed through their fulfillment network for both the last year and continuing into the current year. Approximately 80% of the growth in square footage is expected to come online in the latter half of the year, which echoes a similar pattern from the previous year when they added 30% more fulfillment space with the majority becoming operational in the second half.

- **Content Spending**: Content spend, particularly for video, is anticipated to continue rising, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis, into Q3. This spend reflects Amazon's ongoing commitment to boost their digital content offerings.

- **Technological Infrastructure**: Due to robust usage growth at AWS (Amazon Web Services), there's an uptick in infrastructure spending, signified by a 71% year-over-year increase in capital leases, supporting enhancements in AWS services and geographical expansion.

**Employment Growth**

- **Headcount Increase**: The company highlighted a 42% rise in employment, outpacing their revenue growth. This rise was attributed to an increased hiring rate for software engineers and sales teams, mainly to support the AWS and advertising branches of Amazon.

**AWS and Price Adjustments**

- **Revenue Impact**: Despite price adjustments that took place in May, AWS showcased a significant increase in its revenue run rate from $14 billion to $16 billion. Growth was strong in Q2 with an expansion in gross margin by 130 basis points. The impact of these price cuts was acknowledged but not quantified, and it is presumed that these adjustments have been factored into the Q3 guidance.

**Grocery and Physical Presence**

- **Strategy for Grocery**: Amazon's strategy in the grocery space continues to be multifaceted, with no single solution being pursued. They are testing various formats like Amazon Go, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, and with the impending acquisition of Whole Foods Market, the company expects to leverage Whole Foods' brand reputation and combine it with Amazon's existing services. The interplay or overlap with Fresh and other services was not clearly depicted.

- **Physical Stores Rationale**: The benefit of Amazon's physical stores, such as their bookstores, was discussed as allowing customers to engage directly with Amazon's devices, particularly the Echo devices. This is seen as enhancing the customer experience and helping customers understand the products better.

**Seasonality and Guidance**

- **Q3 Seasonality**: It was stated that Q3 is usually characterized by lower operating income due to preparations for the Q4 holiday peak season.

- **Guidance Factors**: The provided guidance includes observed order trends and what the management believes are reasonable assumptions. Factors influencing the guidance are diverse, including but not limited to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, global economic conditions, customer spending, world events, growth of internet and online commerce, and cloud services. The guidance also excludes any potential impact from the proposed acquisition of Whole Foods Market since the deal had not closed by the date of the earnings call.

**Key Caveats**

- **Unpredictability and Exclusions**: The company reiterates that their results are unpredictable and could be materially affected by various unknown factors, and they excluded any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements that have not yet been concluded from their guidance. They also emphasized the impossibility of accurately predicting demand for their goods and services. The statements were forward-looking, and actual results could materially differ from the guidance provided.",gpt-4

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

Mark Alan May,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Question on the comments around the fulfillment investments.

Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016.\nOur comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 27, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.\nOur guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and excludes the impact of our proposed acquisition of Whole Foods Market. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.\nWith that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\n\n\n================================================================================\nQuestions and Answers\n================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHeath P. Terry,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          I was just wondering if you could give us a sense on the investments that are planned in Q3. Previously, you've been willing to provide sort of some qualitative guidance around how you're rank ordering those in terms of the ones that are -- the largest areas of investment in the quarter. Just wondering if you could update us on that just given the guidance for Q3 and what we saw in investment in Q2.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. Let me see what I can tell you on that. First of all, I want to remind you that Q3 is typically a lower operating income quarter as we're preparing for the Q4 holiday peak. The other dynamic is that similar to last year, a large percentage of our new fulfillment centers are coming online in the second half of the year, a lot of them in Q3. So to give that some perspective, the Amazon-Fulfilled Network or the combination of retail and FBA shipments coming out of our warehouses has been nearly 40%. It was that last year and it's continued through this year. Last year, we added 30% additional square footage to handle that additional shipping volume, and about 80% of that went in to service in the back end of last year. That's what I mentioned about this time last year. The -- similar dynamic this year. We're going to have about 80% of our increase in square footage for fulfillment and shipping coming online in the back end of the year. So that's a major increase. The other comment I would make is on the content -- video content. Video content, last year I highlighted the fact that it was going to be a significant step up between first half -- second half of 2016 and the second half of 2015. We are still -- we lapped that most of the first half of this year, and we'll also be increasing video spend on a sequential and year-over-year basis in Q3 and that's included in this guidance. Other than that, I can't give much more specifics except to say that the large investment areas remain increasing fulfillment capacity to service the strong growth of the FBA business. I'll also point out that the strong usage growth at AWS has led us to a step up in infrastructure in the form of capital leases. We've built capital leases in the trailing 12 months. They've increased 71% through the end of Q2 versus last year. That is servicing -- accelerating usage in our largest AWS services as well as geographic expansion. So that's additional factor sequentially in the quarter year-over-year.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nColin Alan Sebastian,  Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          A question on the grocery category and the announcement that we have -- that we heard recently. Specifically, does that imply that the strategy has changed around Fresh, which was presumably replacing the trip to the grocery store? Or should we think about adding different modes, such as pickup points and bricks-and-mortar, as serving a distinct customer base or geared to reduce the cost bottleneck around home delivery? Any comments would be helpful.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure, Colin. First, as far as Whole Foods is concerned, as Darin mentioned, it's not included in this guidance since it hasn't closed yet, but we are excited about that acquisition and looking forward to working with the team at Whole Foods. We think they're very customer-centric just like us. They've built a great business focused around quality and customers. So we're really glad to join up with them. On your larger question about with the place of AmazonFresh, that include Prime Now and some of our other efforts, I would say we believe there will be no one solution. So we're experimenting with a number of the formats, from physical pickup points in Amazon Go to online ordering and delivery to your door through Prime Now and AmazonFresh. And we'll see how customers respond. We like the response that we've seen so far. We think they're valuable. All those are valuable services. Amazon Go is not out of beta, but the other ones are. On top of that, we're looking forward to adding the Whole Foods team and their great reputation for quality and customer service to this offering.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJustin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          A couple of questions. It definitely seems relative to your guidance, you may have stepped up spending in the second quarter. Anything in particular to call out, India or anything like that? And then just thinking bigger picture, I'm wondering why physical locations might make sense for Amazon. Why is that a positive use of capital going forward?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. As far as Q2 is concerned, we were very encouraged by the revenue and unit growth acceleration, particularly in North America. We see that as tied to the Prime growth and the adoption of Prime and success of that program. Also point out that AWS stepped up its run rate from a $14 billion run rate last quarter to $16 billion. So we saw the largest quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increase in revenue in that businesses as well, and gross margin expanded 130 basis points. So as you point out, the year-over-year difference is primarily driven by investments. The -- we're within the guidance range, and we continue to invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistic services, digital video, our Echo and Alexa -- Echo devices and Alexa platform, India, the buildup at AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned, not to mention Prime Now and AmazonFresh and Prime benefits. We did see a big jump in headcount in year-over-year. You'll see it's 42%, and in the past I've said most of that is driven by operations hiring. And I've even said that headquarters office hiring many times in the past was below the level of revenue growth. Right now what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising. So yes, those -- the growth rate of those 2 job categories actually exceeded the company growth rates. So we are adding -- having success hiring a lot of people and pointing them at some very important programs and customer-facing efforts. On the place of physical, again, as I mentioned in the earlier question, we are experimenting with a number of formats. You've seen the physical bookstores, and I would say that the benefit there is -- again, we have a curated selection of titles and it's also a great opportunity for people to touch and feel our devices and see them, especially the new Echo devices. I went into the store in Seattle last week and I saw about 1/3 of the people were standing around the device table, learning how they work, how they interact with the devices. So I saw firsthand the customer experience. I think that's where we're seeing the benefit to the physical stores right now.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Alan May,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Question on the comments around the fulfillment investments. Could you characterize or maybe even quantify how much of the fulfillment infrastructure investment that you're making is going to incrementally gear towards handling growth in sort of the existing business and infrastructure versus expanding your capabilities in fulfillment, like adding more inbound or last mile and/or from entering new international markets where you need to invest ahead of growth versus just sort of keeping up and maintaining growth within sort of your existing footprint? And then AWS, you had some price adjustments in May, yet the Q2 growth was quite good. Can you just comment about the impact that those cuts may have had in Q2? And if you're modeling those also in your Q3 guidance, maybe the impact there.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nB""}","From the earnings call transcript of Amazon.com Inc for Q2 2017, several key insights can be synthesized:

1. Q3 is typically a lower operating income quarter, as the company prepares for the Q4 holiday peak. Additionally, a large percentage of new fulfillment centers will come online in the second half of the year, particularly in Q3. This reflects the continued growth and expansion of Amazon's retail and FBA shipments, which have increased by nearly 40%.

2. The company continues to invest in increasing fulfillment capacity to service the strong growth of its FBA business. This includes adding 80% of the increase in square footage for fulfillment and shipping in the back end of the year, as well as investments in logistic services.

3. Amazon is also increasing its investment in video content, both sequentially and year-over-year in Q3. This reflects the company's focus on expanding its video services and offerings.

4. The growth of Amazon Web Services (AWS) has led to an increase in infrastructure, including capital leases, to support the accelerating usage and geographic expansion of the service. AWS saw a significant quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increase in revenue and a 130 basis points expansion in gross margin.

5. The acquisition of Whole Foods Market is not included in the Q3 guidance, as it has not yet closed. However, the company is excited about the acquisition and looks forward to working with the Whole Foods team to enhance their offerings and customer service.

6. Amazon is experimenting with different formats for its grocery category, including physical pickup points, online ordering and delivery, and its Amazon Go concept. The company believes there will be no one solution and is focused on providing valuable services to cater to different customer needs.

7. The company saw revenue and unit growth acceleration, particularly in North America, which is attributed to the growth and adoption of the Prime program. AWS also experienced strong growth in revenue and gross margin expansion.

8. In terms of spending, Amazon has been investing in various areas such as fulfillment capacity, logistic services, digital video, Echo devices and Alexa platform, AWS infrastructure, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, and hiring software engineers and sales teams to support AWS and advertising.

In summary, Amazon continues to focus on expanding its fulfillment capacity, increasing investments in video content and AWS infrastructure, and experimenting with different formats to cater to customer needs in the grocery category. The company remains confident in its growth prospects and is guided by the seasonality of its business and its ongoing investments to support future growth.",gpt-3

          Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I guess the standout metric of the quarter was the profitability and the margins. Both U.S. and international have improved year-over-year. Could you talk about, was it better than your expectations for the quarter? And then maybe a reason for the ad business to accelerate within the other line.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, yes. Thanks, Justin. Yes, for the quarter, so it was a strong quarter. We had, what I attribute it to is continued strength in some of our most profitable areas. AWS had its third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, 49% FX-neutral growth. Advertising also had strong growth. Elsewhere, we saw probably better-than-expected efficiencies in operations, our infrastructure costs and generally all of our fixed costs. You'll note that in the first half of the year, capital leases were flat year-over-year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months. In the last 6 months it's been pretty flat as the team has really worked well to plan our data centers, run our data centers more efficiently even to meet, again, increasing usage by our customers, usage rates that are exceeding our growth rate. So that's what I would point to. Internationally, a lot of the same factors hold. I would say that in addition to the operating efficiencies, advertising is also starting to make an impact on gross profit, although advertising is smaller in international segment than it is in North America. It's growing at the same rapid clip year-over-year. Even while in international, we're continuing to invest in a lot of areas. We continue to frontload Prime benefits for the newer geographies. We continue to launch new countries. We launched Prime in Australia recently. We've launched devices in multiple countries. Echo and Alexa were launched in France. Echo Spot was launched in India and Japan in the last quarter. So continued -- it's a mix of operating efficiencies as we grow and then also continuing to invest on a lot of fronts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. Hey, maybe 2 things. Just a little bit of color on that unit growth. I think it was 17%. Any particular things to call out there that would have stunted that growth or negatively limit it? Or is that just kind of a new, new normal? And then Brian, I'm sorry. You just talk better-than-expected efficiencies in operations. Can I ask you to tease that out a little bit more? And a little more color, particularly on the retail side of the business. Are there particularly newfound efficiencies that are sustainable?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Let's start with the unit growth. So I will note, we did a very strong unit growth rate last year in Q2 with 27%, so we're comping against that. As we look back on that, there were a number of factors. I mean, in any quarter, there can be product mix or ASP differentials would shift the unit growth figure, but if you also remember, we dropped our Super Saver shipping threshold twice in early part of last year from $49 to $35 and then down to $25. So there was a bit of growth, particularly in lower ASP items from that, that we saw a last year. So we're comping that. Another factor is digital content that moves to subscription. So Amazon Music and Kindle Unlimited, while they're very successful and it's a good transition, they just -- the units do not count in this unit calculation. So there's some things like that, that maybe obfuscate the numbers a bit, but we're really pleased with the retail growth. We think it's driven by, again, Prime -- the Prime program, the efficiency -- or excuse me, the engagement of Prime customers as well as increased selection and particularly third-party selection. On operations, if you look at probably the last 18 months, you're going to see a lot of different pace of increase in both infrastructure, cost and capital cost and the addition of fixed cost heads. So one thing that you'll notice is that we've grown -- that we've stepped down our rate of growth of fixed headcount, excluding acquisitions. We've grown 26% year-over-year at the end of June on a trailing 12-month basis. But the 23% of that was in the second half of last year. So we are continuing to look at where we're investing headcount. We're seeing a lot of our growth areas being fueled by headcount that's moving within the company. There's a lot of movement of tech headcount. And so there was less external hiring in the first half of this year. We don't think that, that's necessarily the long-term trend, but it's certainly created a lot of operating efficiencies and now we'll reset and evaluate where we need to still add people. So I think the first half of the year can be a good test of where our cost structure is coming off of the investment that leads up to the holiday. Last year, there was a lot of first half investment. If you look back on infrastructure and fixed headcount, that may be made that less pronounced. But this year, it's a little more apparent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I want to ask 2 if I could. First, 3Q is typically a heavy fulfillment center build-out period, ahead of the holidays and then lower utilization, but obviously your outlook is good. Can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about FC build-out in square footage increases this year? And then secondly, a lot of excitement around the pharmacy opportunity with the acquisition of PillPack. Can you frame some of the strategic rationale there around the acquisition and how that helps advance your efforts and how we should think about integration going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. On the fulfillment center capacity, I don't have a number for you today. I'll probably clarify that at the end of next quarter as we head into the holiday. But if you think back the last 2 years, we've added square footage that's exceeded 30% growth both in 2016 and 2017. We anticipate it's going to be lower this year as we get some efficiencies off what we've built over the last few years. But we don't have a number for you today. I will say that the majority of it is being put in service in the back end of the year, just like in the last 2 years. But we'll clarify that next quarter. On PillPack, yes, the deal of course, hasn't closed yet. We expect to close it in the second half of the year, so I'll limit my comments right now. But we're excited. I think the company has a really highly differentiated customer experience, and they've done a great job getting to the size and scale that they're at today. We think that working together with them, we can expand on that in the future. They're like a lot of the other acquisitions we've done. Recently, we're looking for well-run companies with highly differentiated customer experience and a real sense of customer obsession that matches ours. So we think PillPack has got all those traits, and we look forward to the deal closing and working with them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Alan May,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On AWS, does the backlog there give you confidence in the ability for this business to continue to post the type of robust growth that you've seen of late? And on Alexa, now that you're reaching a meaningful number of Alexa users, I wondered if you could discuss a bit more about how Alexa is impacting their retail business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Let me start with AWS. Yes, we're very happy with the results we're seeing and the backlog that we see and the new contracts and new customers and the expansion of existing customer business that we see.

And then maybe a reason for the ad business to accelerate within the other line.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure, yes. Thanks, Justin. Yes, for the quarter, so it was a strong quarter. We had, what I attribute it to is continued strength in some of our most profitable areas. AWS had its third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, 49% FX-neutral growth. Advertising also had strong growth. Elsewhere, we saw probably better-than-expected efficiencies in operations, our infrastructure costs and generally all of our fixed costs. You'll note that in the first half of the year, capital leases were flat year-over-year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months. In the last 6 months it's been pretty flat as the team has really worked well to plan our data centers, run our data centers more efficiently even to meet, again, increasing usage by our customers, usage rates that are exceeding our growth rate. So that's what I would point to. Internationally, a lot of the same factors hold. I would say that in addition to the operating efficiencies, advertising is also starting to make an impact on gross profit, although advertising is smaller in international segment than it is in North America. It's growing at the same rapid clip year-over-year. Even while in international, we're continuing to invest in a lot of areas. We continue to frontload Prime benefits for the newer geographies. We continue to launch new countries. We launched Prime in Australia recently. We've launched devices in multiple countries. Echo and Alexa were launched in France. Echo Spot was launched in India and Japan in the last quarter. So continued -- it's a mix of operating efficiencies as we grow and then also continuing to invest on a lot of fronts.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Okay. Hey, maybe 2 things. Just a little bit of color on that unit growth. I think it was 17%. Any particular things to call out there that would have stunted that growth or negatively limit it? Or is that just kind of a new, new normal? And then Brian, I'm sorry. You just talk better-than-expected efficiencies in operations. Can I ask you to tease that out a little bit more? And a little more color, particularly on the retail side of the business. Are there particularly newfound efficiencies that are sustainable?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. Let's start with the unit growth. So I will note, we did a very strong unit growth rate last year in Q2 with 27%, so we're comping against that. As we look back on that, there were a number of factors. I mean, in any quarter, there can be product mix or ASP differentials would shift the unit growth figure, but if you also remember, we dropped our Super Saver shipping threshold twice in early part of last year from $49 to $35 and then down to $25. So there was a bit of growth, particularly in lower ASP items from that, that we saw a last year. So we're comping that. Another factor is digital content that moves to subscription. So Amazon Music and Kindle Unlimited, while they're very successful and it's a good transition, they just -- the units do not count in this unit calculation. So there's some things like that, that maybe obfuscate the numbers a bit, but we're really pleased with the retail growth. We think it's driven by, again, Prime -- the Prime program, the efficiency -- or excuse me, the engagement of Prime customers as well as increased selection and particularly third-party selection. On operations, if you look at probably the last 18 months, you're going to see a lot of different pace of increase in both infrastructure, cost and capital cost and the addition of fixed cost heads. So one thing that you'll notice is that we've grown -- that we've stepped down our rate of growth of fixed headcount, excluding acquisitions. We've grown 26% year-over-year at the end of June on a trailing 12-month basis. But the 23% of that was in the second half of last year. So we are continuing to look at where we're investing headcount. We're seeing a lot of our growth areas being fueled by headcount that's moving within the company. There's a lot of movement of tech headcount. And so there was less external hiring in the first half of this year. We don't think that, that's necessarily the long-term trend, but it's certainly created a lot of operating efficiencies and now we'll reset and evaluate where we need to still add people. So I think the first half of the year can be a good test of where our cost structure is coming off of the investment that leads up to the holiday. Last year, there was a lot of first half investment. If you look back on infrastructure and fixed headcount, that may be made that less pronounced. But this year, it's a little more apparent.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDouglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          I want to ask 2 if I could. First, 3Q is typically a heavy fulfillment center build-out period, ahead of the holidays and then lower utilization, but obviously your outlook is good. Can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about FC build-out in square footage increases this year? And then secondly, a lot of excitement around the pharmacy opportunity with the acquisition of PillPack. Can you frame some of the strategic rationale there around the acquisition and how that helps advance your efforts and how we should think about integration going forward?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. On the fulfillment center capacity, I don't have a number for you today. I'll probably clarify that at the end of next quarter as we head into the holiday. But if you think back the last 2 years, we've added square footage that's exceeded 30% growth both in 2016 and 2017. We anticipate it's going to be lower this year as we get some efficiencies off what we've built over the last few years. But we don't have a number for you today. I will say that the majority of it is being put in service in the back end of the year, just like in the last 2 years. But we'll clarify that next quarter. On PillPack, yes, the deal of course, hasn't closed yet. We expect to close it in the second half of the year, so I'll limit my comments right now. But we're excited. I think the company has a really highly differentiated customer experience, and they've done a great job getting to the size and scale that they're at today. We think that working together with them, we can expand on that in the future. They're like a lot of the other acquisitions we've done. Recently, we're looking for well-run companies with highly differentiated customer experience and a real sense of customer obsession that matches ours. So we think PillPack has got all those traits, and we look forward to the deal closing and working with them.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Alan May,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          On AWS, does the backlog there give you confidence in the ability for this business to continue to post the type of robust growth that you've seen of late? And on Alexa, now that you're reaching a meaningful number of Alexa users, I wondered if you could discuss a bit more about how Alexa is impacting their retail business.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [12]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. Let me start with AWS. Yes, we're very happy with the results we're seeing and the backlog that we see and the new contracts and new customers and the expansion of existing customer business that we see. ""}","Amazon's Q2 2018 earnings call, led by CFO Brian T. Olsavsky and Director of IR Dave Fildes, revealed several insights into the company's performance and projections.

**Revenue Drivers and Growth:**
- The standout metric was the profitability and margins improvement, better than expectations. Both U.S. and international margins improved year-over-year.
- AWS continued its accelerating growth trend with its third consecutive quarter of growth, reporting 49% FX-neutral growth.
- The advertising business was mentioned as growing strongly and contributing to profitability.
- Unit growth was 17%, lower than the 27% of the same quarter in the previous year. This was partly attributed to high comparison base and changes in shipping threshold, product mix, and ASP differences.
- Prime membership engagement, increased selection, and third-party selection are drivers of retail growth.

**Operational Efficiencies:**
- Amazon reported better-than-expected operating efficiencies in operations and infrastructure costs. Contribution included well-managed data center operations despite increasing usage rates.
- Flat capital leases year-over-year in the past six months despite a 20% increase over the full trailing 12 months.
- Reduced growth rate in fixed headcount, excluding acquisitions, which was 26% year-over-year at the end of June, with 23% growth occurring in the latter half of the previous year.

**Guidance and Assumptions:**
- Guidance incorporated current order trends and what they believed to be appropriate assumptions at that time.
- They did not conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements.
- Acknowledged the unpredictable nature of demand for goods and services, stating that actual results could differ materially from guidance.

**Concerns and Considerations:**
- The impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, global economic conditions, world events, and the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services were noted as external factors that could affect financial results.
- The conversation noted the seasonal nature of fulfillment center buildout, earmarked typically for the back end of the year, and expected a lower square footage increase than in the previous two years (>30%).

**Strategic Moves:**
- Echo and Alexa were introduced in France, and Echo Spot in India and Japan, with the intention of enhancing the retail business and user engagement.
- The acquisition of PillPack was discussed, framing it as a way to deliver a highly differentiated customer experience that aligns with Amazon's customer obsession, though specifics on integration were not disclosed.

No specific numerical figures on EBITDA, capital structure, debt, free cash flow, hedging activities, liquidity, operating expenses, exact forward guidance figures, or precise KPIs were provided in the available transcript excerpt.

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 26, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I guess the standout metric of the quarter was the profitability and the margins. Both U.S. and international have improved year-over-year. Could you talk about, was it better than your expectations for the quarter? And then maybe a reason for the ad business to accelerate within the other line.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Alan May,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On AWS, does the backlog there give you confidence in the ability for this business to continue to post the type of robust growth that you've seen of late? And on Alexa, now that you're reaching a meaningful number of Alexa users, I wondered if you could discuss a bit more about how Alexa is impacting their retail business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So that's what I would point to. Internationally, a lot of the same factors hold. I would say that in addition to the operating efficiencies, advertising is also starting to make an impact on gross profit, although advertising is smaller in international segment than it is in North America. It's growing at the same rapid clip year-over-year. Even while in international, we're continuing to invest in a lot of areas. We continue to frontload Prime benefits for the newer geographies. We continue to launch new countries. We launched Prime in Australia recently. We've launched devices in multiple countries. Echo and Alexa were launched in France. Echo Spot was launched in India and Japan in the last quarter. So continued -- it's a mix of operating efficiencies as we grow and then also continuing to invest on a lot of fronts.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Okay. Hey, maybe 2 things. Just a little bit of color on that unit growth. I think it was 17%. Any particular things to call out there that would have stunted that growth or negatively limit it? Or is that just kind of a new, new normal? And then Brian, I'm sorry. You just talk better-than-expected efficiencies in operations. Can I ask you to tease that out a little bit more? And a little more color, particularly on the retail side of the business. Are there particularly newfound efficiencies that are sustainable?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. Let's start with the unit growth. So I will note, we did a very strong unit growth rate last year in Q2 with 27%, so we're comping against that. As we look back on that, there were a number of factors. I mean, in any quarter, there can be product mix or ASP differentials would shift the unit growth figure, but if you also remember, we dropped our Super Saver shipping threshold twice in early part of last year from $49 to $35 and then down to $25. So there was a bit of growth, particularly in lower ASP items from that, that we saw a last year. So we're comping that. Another factor is digital content that moves to subscription. So Amazon Music and Kindle Unlimited, while they're very successful and it's a good transition, they just -- the units do not count in this unit calculation. So there's some things like that, that maybe obfuscate the numbers a bit, but we're really pleased with the retail growth. We think it's driven by, again, Prime -- the Prime program, the efficiency -- or excuse me, the engagement of Prime customers as well as increased selection and particularly third-party selection. On operations, if you look at probably the last 18 months, you're going to see a lot of different pace of increase in both infrastructure, cost and capital cost and the addition of fixed cost heads. So one thing that you'll notice is that we've grown -- that we've stepped down our rate of growth of fixed headcount, excluding acquisitions. We've grown 26% year-over-year at the end of June on a trailing 12-month basis. But the 23% of that was in the second half of last year. So we are continuing to look at where we're investing headcount. We're seeing a lot of our growth areas being fueled by headcount that's moving within the company. There's a lot of movement of tech headcount. And so there was less external hiring in the first half of this year. We don't think that, that's necessarily the long-term trend, but it's certainly created a lot of operating efficiencies and now we'll reset and evaluate where we need to still add people. So I think the first half of the year can be a good test of where our cost structure is coming off of the investment that leads up to the holiday. Last year, there was a lot of first half investment. If you look back on infrastructure and fixed headcount, that may be made that less pronounced. But this year, it's a little more apparent.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDouglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          I want to ask 2 if I could. First, 3Q is typically a heavy fulfillment center build-out period, ahead of the holidays and then lower utilization, but obviously your outlook is good. Can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about FC build-out in square footage increases this year? And then secondly, a lot of excitement around the pharmacy opportunity with the acquisition of PillPack. Can you frame some of the strategic rationale there around the acquisition and how that helps advance your efforts and how we should think about integration going forward?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. On the fulfillment center capacity, I don't have a number for you today. I'll probably clarify that at the end of next quarter as we head into the holiday. But if you think back the last 2 years, we've added square footage that's exceeded 30% growth both in 2016 and 2017. We anticipate it's going to be lower this year as we get some efficiencies off what we've built over the last few years. But we don't have a number for you today. I will say that the majority of it is being put in service in the back end of the year, just like in the last 2 years. But we'll clarify that next quarter. On PillPack, yes, the deal of course, hasn't closed yet. We expect to close it in the second half of the year, so I'll limit my comments right now. But we're excited. I think the company has a really highly differentiated customer experience, and they've done a great job getting to the size and scale that they're at today. We think that working together with them, we can expand on that in the future. They're like a lot of the other acquisitions we've done. Recently, we're looking for well-run companies with highly differentiated customer experience and a real sense of customer obsession that matches ours. So we think PillPack has got all those traits, and we look forward to the deal closing and working with them.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Alan May,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          On AWS, does the backlog there give you confidence in the ability for this business to continue to post the type of robust growth that you've seen of late? And on Alexa, now that you're reaching a meaningful number of Alexa users, I wondered if you could discuss a bit more about how Alexa is impacting their retail business.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [12]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. Let me start with AWS. Yes, we're very happy with the results we're seeing and the backlog that we see and the new contracts and new customers and the expansion of existing customer business that we see. ""}","In the Q2 2018 financial earnings call, Amazon.com reported strong profitability and improved margins compared to the same period in 2017. This was attributed to continued strength in their most profitable areas, such as AWS (Amazon Web Services), which had its third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth with 49% year-over-year growth. Advertising also saw strong growth, contributing to improved profitability.

The company also highlighted better-than-expected efficiencies in operations, particularly in infrastructure costs and fixed costs. They mentioned that capital leases were flat year-over-year in the first half of the year, indicating improved efficiency in data center operations. They attributed this to a combination of operating efficiencies and increased usage by customers, which exceeded their growth rate.

In terms of international operations, similar factors contributed to improved profitability, including operating efficiencies and growth in advertising. However, the impact of advertising on gross profit was smaller in the international segment compared to North America. Despite continued investments in new countries and product launches, Amazon has managed to maintain operating efficiencies and profitability.

During the call, it was mentioned that unit growth in Q2 was lower compared to the previous year, which can be attributed to factors such as product mix, changes in shipping thresholds, and the exclusion of digital content units in the calculation. However, overall retail growth was driven by Prime program engagement, increased selection, and third-party selection.

Regarding fulfillment center capacity, Amazon did not provide a specific number but mentioned that square footage growth is expected to be slower compared to the previous two years as they capitalize on efficiencies gained from previous investments.

The acquisition of PillPack, a pharmacy company, was discussed briefly, with Amazon expressing excitement about the deal and the potential for expansion. PillPack was described as having a highly differentiated customer experience and a strong sense of customer obsession, which aligns with Amazon's values.

In terms of future growth drivers, AWS backlog and new contracts, as well as continued expansion of customer business, provide confidence in the robust growth of the business. Alexa, Amazon's virtual assistant, was mentioned as reaching a significant number of users, but no specific details were provided on its impact on the retail business.

Overall, Amazon's Q2 2018 earnings call highlighted strong profitability, improved margins, and operating efficiencies. The company's key growth drivers, such as AWS and advertising, continue to contribute to their financial performance. The acquisition of PillPack represents a strategic move into the pharmacy industry, and the company is optimistic about the potential for expansion and synergy.",gpt-3

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 25, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I guess the big one is the deceleration in unit growth or online stores which is probably related to that. I know it's a tough Q3 comp, but could you comment a little bit about that? And then kind of what initiatives could be most interesting to maybe reaccelerate that over the next couple of years, what categories?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Justin. Yes, let me just remind you of a couple of things from last year. We had 2 reductions on our super saver shipping threshold in the first half of the year between February and May. That did spur a lot of unit growth in the second and third quarter. We also have issue with digital content -- not an issue, but the fact that digital content is moving to subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited and Kindle Unlimited, in particular. It's been really popular. I'll just remind you just the units, those do not count in our unit totals nor do the units from Whole Foods Market. So yes, I would say, essentially with that backdrop, we're still very encouraged by the demand and the reception from customers. On the consumer side, we have -- Amazon-fulfilled units are still growing faster than paid units. 3P is now up to 53% of total paid units. In-stock is very strong, especially as we head into the holiday period. I think we're well positioned for the holiday. We have over 100 million Prime-eligible items available for free 2-day shipping for Prime members. And again, all -- a lot of -- when I'm talking about the unit deceleration, a lot of the fastest-growing areas, things like subscription services, AWS and advertising, are not caught in that metric.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. And Justin, this is Dave. Just to add on that, you mentioned the online stores, just a reminder there is a little bit of impact from the revenue recognition. So you see the online stores revenue growing about 11% ex FX to be higher than that, but -- for the adoption of the standard. So there's a little bit of a headwind there as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, I was going to also then ask you to drill down a little bit on the international retail business that seemed to slow down, I guess, that -- whatever, 15% or something year-over-year. Any particularly color? Any markets that would've led to that? Though the comp was tougher, but anything else you'd call out there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. So on a year-over-year basis, I think you have to look at 2 things. We did the Souq acquisition last year in May, so the full pick up on that year-over-year was in 2017, and now, we're lapping that. There's also material change in the Diwali calendar in India. About half of our Diwali sales last year were in Q3. This year, they'll be fully in Q4. So those are a couple of factors that hit the international growth area, particularly. But I'll also point out that we launched Turkey in the quarter, and now, we have 17 Amazon websites globally. So we're still very pleased again with the international business, continuing to invest in Prime Benefits, international expansion, as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pick up. Story is different country-by-country, obviously. Some are much further along than others, but overall, we're very happy. India, although Diwali moved into Q4, so far, that's going really well. We've seen great response from customers. We've had 60% growth in new customers during the period. Orders are coming in from 99% of the pin codes in the country. So a great first wave of the -- what we call the Amazon's Great Indian Festival, which leads into Diwali.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          You had significant operating income upside in 3Q relative to your guide. Could you just talk about the biggest drivers there in terms of out-performance? And then when you think about your 4Q outlook, how should we think about the minimum wage increase that you've talked about? And any other one-time or special items that might be weighing on that operating income outlook?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Let me start with Q3. And this will be a commentary pretty much on the whole year. That was especially true in Q4. So first of all, we've had very strong growth in some very profitable businesses that we have, most notably AWS and advertising. But we've also had great cost performance this year in 3 specific areas I'll call out. So first, on headcount. If you'll remember, we grew headcount 48% in 2016 and 38% last year, if you adjust for Whole Foods. With Whole Foods, it was 66%. But without Whole Foods, we still grew 38%. We have looked to really leverage our investment from the last couple of years. And as we funded and moved, invested in a lot of new areas, as we've talked about AWS, devices, digital content, we've had a lot of movement within the company that has filled a lot of these roles. So we're only up 13% on headcount through 9 months year-over-year, so a real step-down in that. Again, the theme here is going to be banking some of the investments from prior years and looking to gain greater control. In our fulfillment center world, we had grown square footage for our fulfillment center and shipping areas by over 30% the last 2 years, 2016 and 2017. I've talked about that in prior calls. It's -- we're making that investment to match up with very strong Fulfilled by Amazon demand and AFN, or Amazon-Fulfilled Network units, that are growing at a faster rate than our paid units. This year, we're only adding about 15% to our square footage. So again, getting better efficiencies on what we have and banking the multi-year investment that we've been making. And the last one which is really significant is on the infrastructure side. You see the operating margin for AWS is up to 31% this quarter. A lot of that is based on efficiencies of our data centers, not only for the AWS business but also for our Amazon consumer businesses, which is AWS' biggest customer. If you look at capital leases, which is where we spend money for the data centers, it's up only 9% year-over-year trailing 12 months, and it was up 69% last year at the end of the year. So those 3 areas have driven a lot of the cost performance and a lot of the deviation from probably the estimates that I've come up with this year. So we are really happy that, again, we're seeing great cost performance in a number of areas across the business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Alan May,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          A question on AWS. Obviously, in the last few quarters, you've seen accelerating revenue growth. This quarter, 46%. Still quite strong. But dollar and percentage growth did slow. And I'm just kind of curious, are you just reaching a point in terms of law of large numbers, where it will be more difficult to sustain, not only accelerating growth but sustain kind of the 40-plus-percent growth levels where we've been recently? Or was there something else going on kind of in the quarter that maybe drove that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, thanks for your question. This growth rate's going to bounce around. We've had seque

Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Okay, I was going to also then ask you to drill down a little bit on the international retail business that seemed to slow down, I guess, that -- whatever, 15% or something year-over-year. Any particularly color? Any markets that would've led to that? Though the comp was tougher, but anything else you'd call out there?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. So on a year-over-year basis, I think you have to look at 2 things. We did the Souq acquisition last year in May, so the full pick up on that year-over-year was in 2017, and now, we're lapping that. There's also material change in the Diwali calendar in India. About half of our Diwali sales last year were in Q3. This year, they'll be fully in Q4. So those are a couple of factors that hit the international growth area, particularly. But I'll also point out that we launched Turkey in the quarter, and now, we have 17 Amazon websites globally. So we're still very pleased again with the international business, continuing to invest in Prime Benefits, international expansion, as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pick up. Story is different country-by-country, obviously. Some are much further along than others, but overall, we're very happy. India, although Diwali moved into Q4, so far, that's going really well. We've seen great response from customers. We've had 60% growth in new customers during the period. Orders are coming in from 99% of the pin codes in the country. So a great first wave of the -- what we call the Amazon's Great Indian Festival, which leads into Diwali.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDouglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          You had significant operating income upside in 3Q relative to your guide. Could you just talk about the biggest drivers there in terms of out-performance? And then when you think about your 4Q outlook, how should we think about the minimum wage increase that you've talked about? And any other one-time or special items that might be weighing on that operating income outlook?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. Let me start with Q3. And this will be a commentary pretty much on the whole year. That was especially true in Q4. So first of all, we've had very strong growth in some very profitable businesses that we have, most notably AWS and advertising. But we've also had great cost performance this year in 3 specific areas I'll call out. So first, on headcount. If you'll remember, we grew headcount 48% in 2016 and 38% last year, if you adjust for Whole Foods. With Whole Foods, it was 66%. But without Whole Foods, we still grew 38%. We have looked to really leverage our investment from the last couple of years. And as we funded and moved, invested in a lot of new areas, as we've talked about AWS, devices, digital content, we've had a lot of movement within the company that has filled a lot of these roles. So we're only up 13% on headcount through 9 months year-over-year, so a real step-down in that. Again, the theme here is going to be banking some of the investments from prior years and looking to gain greater control. In our fulfillment center world, we had grown square footage for our fulfillment center and shipping areas by over 30% the last 2 years, 2016 and 2017. I've talked about that in prior calls. It's -- we're making that investment to match up with very strong Fulfilled by Amazon demand and AFN, or Amazon-Fulfilled Network units, that are growing at a faster rate than our paid units. This year, we're only adding about 15% to our square footage. So again, getting better efficiencies on what we have and banking the multi-year investment that we've been making. And the last one which is really significant is on the infrastructure side. You see the operating margin for AWS is up to 31% this quarter. A lot of that is based on efficiencies of our data centers, not only for the AWS business but also for our Amazon consumer businesses, which is AWS' biggest customer. If you look at capital leases, which is where we spend money for the data centers, it's up only 9% year-over-year trailing 12 months, and it was up 69% last year at the end of the year. So those 3 areas have driven a lot of the cost performance and a lot of the deviation from probably the estimates that I've come up with this year. So we are really happy that, again, we're seeing great cost performance in a number of areas across the business.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Alan May,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst    [12]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          A question on AWS. Obviously, in the last few quarters, you've seen accelerating revenue growth. This quarter, 46%. Still quite strong. But dollar and percentage growth did slow. And I'm just kind of curious, are you just reaching a point in terms of law of large numbers, where it will be more difficult to sustain, not only accelerating growth but sustain kind of the 40-plus-percent growth levels where we've been recently? Or was there something else going on kind of in the quarter that maybe drove that?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [13]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Yes, thanks for your question. This growth rate's going to bounce around. We've had seque""}","During the Q3 2018 earnings call for Amazon.com Inc., several key points were discussed, providing insights into the company's performance. 

Revenue Growth & Unit Growth Deceleration: 
Amazon's unit growth showed deceleration, partially attributed to a tough comparison with Q3 2017, where there had been a significant spur in unit growth due to reduced super saver shipping thresholds. Additionally, factors such as the transition of digital content towards subscription models (Amazon Music Unlimited, Kindle Unlimited) which do not count in total unit metrics and the exclusion of Whole Foods Market units were also influencing factors.

International Business:
International growth rates were impacted by a couple of factors. The full effect of the Souq acquisition made the previous year's comparisons challenging. Moreover, a significant change in the calendar timing of Diwali (a key sales period in India) moving completely into Q4 from being partially in Q3 the previous year affected the growth numbers.

Profitable Businesses & Cost Performance:
The company attributed strong growth in profitable businesses, specifically AWS (Amazon Web Services) and advertising, alongside notable cost performance in three areas including headcount, fulfillment center square footage, and infrastructure (efficiencies in data centers for both AWS and Amazon‚Äôs consumer businesses) as contributing to substantial operating income upside. Headcount was up by 13% year-over-year, a step down from previous growth rates, and fulfillment center square footage increased by 15%, significantly lower than prior years' expansion. Capital lease spending for data centers was up only 9% on a trailing 12-month basis, compared to a 69% increase at the end of the previous year.

Operating Income & AWS:
Operating income significantly exceeded guidance, with AWS specifically reaching a 31% operating margin due to efficiencies. Revenue growth for AWS was strong at 46% but showed deceleration in dollar and percentage growth, which could be ascribed to the law of large numbers and not indicative of any specific issue within the quarter.

Guidance Rationale:
The company did not provide explicit forward guidance in the provided segment of the call transcript, but there was a mention of initiatives that could potentially reaccelerate growth in the coming years in various categories.

Impacts of Seasonality & Wage Changes:
Amazon is well-positioned for the holiday season, with strong inventory, 100 million Prime-eligible items available for free 2-day shipping. Additionally, an impending minimum wage increase for Amazon employees was expected to impact financials, although specific implications were not quantified in this section of the call.

All provided data and commentary relate to the period up to October 25, 2018, and are accompanied by the standard forward-looking statements disclaimer, mentioning that actual results may differ materially due to various factors including market conditions, customer spending, and foreign exchange rates. Moreover, the guidance assumed no further business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements and acknowledged the unpredictability of demand for goods and services, indicating that actual results could materially differ from the guidance. 

The narrative refrains from making conclusions or speculations beyond the extracted information. The context provided around each piece of data, including caveats and conditions, adds to understanding the company's operational and financial health during the reported period.",gpt-4

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 25, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I guess the big one is the deceleration in unit growth or online stores which is probably related to that. I know it's a tough Q3 comp, but could you comment a little bit about that? And then kind of what initiatives could be most interesting to maybe reaccelerate that over the next couple of years, what categories?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Justin. Yes, let me just remind you of a couple of things from last year. We had 2 reductions on our super saver shipping threshold in the first half of the year between February and May. That did spur a lot of unit growth in the second and third quarter. We also have issue with digital content -- not an issue, but the fact that digital content is moving to subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited and Kindle Unlimited, in particular. It's been really popular. I'll just remind you just the units, those do not count in our unit totals nor do the units from Whole Foods Market. So yes, I would say, essentially with that backdrop, we're still very encouraged by the demand and the reception from customers. On the consumer side, we have -- Amazon-fulfilled units are still growing faster than paid units. 3P is now up to 53% of total paid units. In-stock is very strong, especially as we head into the holiday period. I think we're well positioned for the holiday. We have over 100 million Prime-eligible items available for free 2-day shipping for Prime members. And again, all -- a lot of -- when I'm talking about the unit deceleration, a lot of the fastest-growing areas, things like subscription services, AWS and advertising, are not caught in that metric.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. And Justin, this is Dave. Just to add on that, you mentioned the online stores, just a reminder there is a little bit of impact from the revenue recognition. So you see the online stores revenue growing about 11% ex FX to be higher than that, but -- for the adoption of the standard. So there's a little bit of a headwind there as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, I was going to also then ask you to drill down a little bit on the international retail business that seemed to slow down, I guess, that -- whatever, 15% or something year-over-year. Any particularly color? Any markets that would've led to that? Though the comp was tougher, but anything else you'd call out there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. So on a year-over-year basis, I think you have to look at 2 things. We did the Souq acquisition last year in May, so the full pick up on that year-over-year was in 2017, and now, we're lapping that. There's also material change in the Diwali calendar in India. About half of our Diwali sales last year were in Q3. This year, they'll be fully in Q4. So those are a couple of factors that hit the international growth area, particularly.

So a great first wave of the -- what we call the Amazon's Great Indian Festival, which leads into Diwali.

          Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.

Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          You had significant operating income upside in 3Q relative to your guide. Could you just talk about the biggest drivers there in terms of out-performance? And then when you think about your 4Q outlook, how should we think about the minimum wage increase that you've talked about? And any other one-time or special items that might be weighing on that operating income outlook?

Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. So on a year-over-year basis, I think you have to look at 2 things. We did the Souq acquisition last year in May, so the full pick up on that year-over-year was in 2017, and now, we're lapping that. There's also material change in the Diwali calendar in India. About half of our Diwali sales last year were in Q3. This year, they'll be fully in Q4. So those are a couple of factors that hit the international growth area, particularly. But I'll also point out that we launched Turkey in the quarter, and now, we have 17 Amazon websites globally. So we're still very pleased again with the international business, continuing to invest in Prime Benefits, international expansion, as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pick up. Story is different country-by-country, obviously. Some are much further along than others, but overall, we're very happy. India, although Diwali moved into Q4, so far, that's going really well. We've seen great response from customers. We've had 60% growth in new customers during the period. Orders are coming in from 99% of the pin codes in the country. So a great first wave of the -- what we call the Amazon's Great Indian Festival, which leads into Diwali.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDouglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          You had significant operating income upside in 3Q relative to your guide. Could you just talk about the biggest drivers there in terms of out-performance? And then when you think about your 4Q outlook, how should we think about the minimum wage increase that you've talked about? And any other one-time or special items that might be weighing on that operating income outlook?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. Let me start with Q3. And this will be a commentary pretty much on the whole year. That was especially true in Q4. So first of all, we've had very strong growth in some very profitable businesses that we have, most notably AWS and advertising. But we've also had great cost performance this year in 3 specific areas I'll call out. So first, on headcount. If you'll remember, we grew headcount 48% in 2016 and 38% last year, if you adjust for Whole Foods. With Whole Foods, it was 66%. But without Whole Foods, we still grew 38%. We have looked to really leverage our investment from the last couple of years. And as we funded and moved, invested in a lot of new areas, as we've talked about AWS, devices, digital content, we've had a lot of movement within the company that has filled a lot of these roles. So we're only up 13% on headcount through 9 months year-over-year, so a real step-down in that. Again, the theme here is going to be banking some of the investments from prior years and looking to gain greater control. In our fulfillment center world, we had grown square footage for our fulfillment center and shipping areas by over 30% the last 2 years, 2016 and 2017. I've talked about that in prior calls. It's -- we're making that investment to match up with very strong Fulfilled by Amazon demand and AFN, or Amazon-Fulfilled Network units, that are growing at a faster rate than our paid units. This year, we're only adding about 15% to our square footage. So again, getting better efficiencies on what we have and banking the multi-year investment that we've been making. And the last one which is really significant is on the infrastructure side. You see the operating margin for AWS is up to 31% this quarter. A lot of that is based on efficiencies of our data centers, not only for the AWS business but also for our Amazon consumer businesses, which is AWS' biggest customer. If you look at capital leases, which is where we spend money for the data centers, it's up only 9% year-over-year trailing 12 months, and it was up 69% last year at the end of the year. So those 3 areas have driven a lot of the cost performance and a lot of the deviation from probably the estimates that I've come up with this year. So we are really happy that, again, we're seeing great cost performance in a number of areas across the business.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Alan May,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst    [12]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          A question on AWS. Obviously, in the last few quarters, you've seen accelerating revenue growth. This quarter, 46%. Still quite strong. But dollar and percentage growth did slow. And I'm just kind of curious, are you just reaching a point in terms of law of large numbers, where it will be more difficult to sustain, not only accelerating growth but sustain kind of the 40-plus-percent growth levels where we've been recently? Or was there something else going on kind of in the quarter that maybe drove that?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [13]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Yes, thanks for your question. This growth rate's going to bounce around. We've had seque""}","- In Q3 2018, Amazon.com reported a deceleration in unit growth in online stores. This was attributed to a reduction in super saver shipping threshold and the fact that digital content, such as Amazon Music Unlimited and Kindle Unlimited, does not count in the unit totals. However, the company remains encouraged by the demand and reception from customers.
- The international retail business also experienced a slowdown in growth, which can be attributed to factors such as the acquisition of Souq in May 2017, changes in the Diwali calendar in India, and the launch of Amazon Turkey. Overall, Amazon is still pleased with the international business and continues to invest in Prime Benefits and international expansion.
- Amazon experienced significant operating income upside in Q3, driven by strong growth in profitable businesses like AWS and advertising. Cost performance was also strong, particularly in areas such as headcount, fulfillment center square footage, and infrastructure. These cost efficiencies contributed to the deviation from earlier estimates.
- AWS revenue growth in Q3 was 46%, which although still strong, experienced a slight slowdown in dollar and percentage growth. Amazon acknowledged that growth rates in AWS may fluctuate and that sustaining high levels of growth may become more challenging due to the law of large numbers.
- Overall, Amazon remains optimistic about its performance and is well-positioned for the holiday season with over 100 million Prime-eligible items available for free 2-day shipping. The company's guidance incorporates the order trends seen to date and various assumptions, but also acknowledges that results are unpredictable and may be affected by external factors.",gpt-3

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2015 financial results teleconference.
(Operator Instructions)
Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please, go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phil Hardin,  Amazon.com Inc - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          
          Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 28, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. Now I will turn the call over to Brian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          
          Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principle repayments increased to $4.7 billion, up from $529 million. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principle repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $2.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.6 billion.
Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth, due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares, compared with 483 million one year ago.
Worldwide revenue increased 22% to $35.7 billion, or 26% excluding the $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 304 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers accounts were approximately 280 million, up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior year period.
Worldwide paid Prime members increased 51% year-over-year. Worldwide seller units represented 47% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represented nearly 50% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon web services customers exceeded 1 million.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $24.3 billion or 68.1% of revenue, compared with 70.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 billion or 27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $4.4 billion or 12.3% of revenue, compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $3.2 billion or 9% of revenue, compared with 8.2%. Marketing was $1.7 billion or 4.8% of revenue, compared with 5.1%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international, and Amazon web services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate segments, our stock-based compensation, or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $21.5 billion. Media revenue grew 11% to $3.9 billion, or 12% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $17.3 billion. North America segment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin, compared with $733 million in the prior year period. North America segment operating income includes $6 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the international segment, revenue grew 12% to $11.8 billion. Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 3% to $3.3 billion, or increased 5% excluding foreign exchange.
EGM revenue grew 19% to $8.5 billion, or 31% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating income was $60 million, compared with $65 million in the prior year. International segment operating income includes $47 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the Amazon web services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion. Amazon web services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior year period. AWS segment operating income includes $60 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income was $1.8 billion or 4.9% of revenue, up approximately 140 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $20 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 88% to $1.1 billion. Our income tax expense was $453 million. GAAP net income was $482 million or $1 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $214 million and $0.45 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $107 billion, or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $63.7 billion, or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. International revenue grew 6% to $35.4 billion, or 21% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
Excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, Germany revenue grew 18%. Japan revenue grew 19%, and UK revenue grew 16%. AWS revenue grew 70% to $7.9 billion.
Consolidated segment operating income was $4.5 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $16 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion, compared with $178 million in the prior year.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $19.8 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 billion. And inventory turns were 8.5, down from 8.6 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $20.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 77 from 73 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy, and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, recording further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
For Q1 2016, we expect net sales of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion, or growth of between 17% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $100 million and $700 million, compared with $255 million in first quarter of 2015.
This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses net. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense net, to be between $700 million and $1.3 billion, compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 2015.
We are grateful to our customers, and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first, is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.

          Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

Operator    [1]

          (Operator Instructions)
Thank you. Our first question is coming from analyst, Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen Ju,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          
          Okay, thanks. So Brian, I think in the past, you've given some indication as to what usage growth may be at AWS. I was wondering if you have an update for that in the fourth quarter? And secondarily, is there any way to characterize what the pricing environment is right now for AWS as well? Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          
          Yes, thanks, Stephen. No, I don't have a usage growth number for you. We'll say we're -- it's been very strong. AWS revenue is on a -- just short of a $10 billion run rate at the end of Q4.
As far as pricing is concerned, we had a price reduction in January for our EC2 services. It was our 51st price reduction since we launched AWS years ago. And generally, what we find is that price is important, but so is speed and agility for customers, and the ability to deliver services and features that are beneficial to them. I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015, and that was up 40% year-over-year. So we feel we have a lead in this space. And we don't take it for granted, and we want to serve customers better each year.

CSOI includes $16 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion, compared with $178 million in the prior year.\nTurning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $19.8 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 billion. And inventory turns were 8.5, down from 8.6 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $20.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 77 from 73 in the prior year.\nI'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy, and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.\nAs we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, recording further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.\nFor Q1 2016, we expect net sales of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion, or growth of between 17% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $100 million and $700 million, compared with $255 million in first quarter of 2015.\nThis includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses net. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense net, to be between $700 million and $1.3 billion, compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 2015.\nWe are grateful to our customers, and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first, is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPhil Hardin,  Amazon.com Inc - Director of IR    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          \n          Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\n\n\n================================================================================\nQuestions and Answers\n================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          \n          (Operator Instructions)\nThank you. Our first question is coming from analyst, Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStephen Ju,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          \n          Okay, thanks. So Brian, I think in the past, you've given some indication as to what usage growth may be at AWS. I was wondering if you have an update for that in the fourth quarter? And secondarily, is there any way to characterize what the pricing environment is right now for AWS as well? Thank you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc - CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          \n          Yes, thanks, Stephen. No, I don't have a usage growth number for you. We'll say we're -- it's been very strong. AWS revenue is on a -- just short of a $10 billion run rate at the end of Q4.\nAs far as pricing is concerned, we had a price reduction in January for our EC2 services. It was our 51st price reduction since we launched AWS years ago. And generally, what we find is that price is important, but so is speed and agility for customers, and the ability to deliver services and features that are beneficial to them. I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015, and that was up 40% year-over-year. So we feel we have a lead in this space. And we don't take it for granted, and we want to serve customers better each year.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStephen Ju,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          \n          Thank you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          \n          Thank you.

### Revenue and Growth:
- **Total Revenue**: Increased by 22% to reach $35.7 billion, or 26% on a constant currency basis (excluding the $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange).
- **Operating Cash Flow**: Trailing 12-month operating cash flow rose by 74% to $11.9 billion.
- **Free Cash Flow**: Trailing 12-month free cash flow expanded to $7.3 billion from $1.9 billion.
- **Free Cash Flow Adjustments**: Free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $4.7 billion (up from $529 million), and less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases to $2.5 billion (up from an outflow of $2.2 billion).
- **Capital Expenditures**: Trailing 12-month capex was $4.6 billion, reflecting investments in technology infrastructure (primarily to support AWS) and fulfillment operations.

### Units and Customer Growth:
- **Paid Unit Growth**: Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%.
- **Active Customer Accounts**: Grew to 304 million worldwide; active accounts excluding those with only free orders in the past 12 months stood at approximately 280 million (increase from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior year period).
- **Prime Members**: Worldwide paid Prime members surged by 51% year-over-year.
- **Seller Units**: Seller units constituted 47% of paid units.

### Operating Expenses:
- **Cost of Sales**: $24.3 billion or 68.1% of revenue (down from 70.5%).
- **Combined Operating Expenses**: Excluding stock-based compensation, totaled $9.7 billion or 27.1% of sales (100 basis points increase year-over-year).

- **International**: Revenue grew 12% (22% excluding foreign exchange effects); operating income was $60 million with $47 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.

### Balance Sheet Snapshot:

- **Inventory**: Increased by 23% to $10.2 billion.
- **Accounts Payable**: Grew 24% to $20.4 billion.

## Guidance and Rationale:

### Q1 2016 Expectations:
- **Net Sales Expectation**: Estimated to be between $26.5 billion and $29 billion, translating to growth of between 17% and 28%. This includes an assumed unfavorable impact of approximately 130 basis points from foreign exchange rates.
- **GAAP Operating Income**: Expected to be between $100 million and $700 million, including approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses.

The company's guidance for the first quarter of 2016 reflects their conservative estimates based on current trends and the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, the global economy, and customer spending. The guidance does not account for additional business activities such as acquisitions, investments, or restructurings that could not be foreseen at the time of the call. The assumptions for guidance are based on recent foreign exchange rates.

### Customer Value Focus:
- The company emphasizes its commitment to customer experience as a driver for shareholder value, indicating that this strategy will continue to be a focus going forward.

## Consolidated Considerations:

While sharing detailed quantitative performance indicators and guidance, the call highlights investments in growth, particularly in the AWS segment and fulfillment operations, which signify areas of strategic focus. There is an acknowledgment of various factors contributing to unpredictability in their operating environment, which is reflected in the broad range provided for Q1 2016 operating income guidance. The results portray strong customer growth and a significant leap in free cash flow. However, the impact of exchange rates on international revenue and segment operating income suggests a significant exposure to global economic factors.",gpt-4

Operator    [1]

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2015 financial results teleconference.
(Operator Instructions)
Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please, go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phil Hardin,  Amazon.com Inc - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          
          Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 28, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. Now I will turn the call over to Brian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          
          Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principle repayments increased to $4.7 billion, up from $529 million. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principle repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $2.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.6 billion.
Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth, due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares, compared with 483 million one year ago.
Worldwide revenue increased 22% to $35.7 billion, or 26% excluding the $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 304 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers accounts were approximately 280 million, up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior year period.
Worldwide paid Prime members increased 51% year-over-year. Worldwide seller units represented 47% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represented nearly 50% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon web services customers exceeded 1 million.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $24.3 billion or 68.1% of revenue, compared with 70.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 billion or 27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $4.4 billion or 12.3% of revenue, compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $3.2 billion or 9% of revenue, compared with 8.2%. Marketing was $1.7 billion or 4.8% of revenue, compared with 5.1%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international, and Amazon web services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate segments, our stock-based compensation, or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $21.5 billion. Media revenue grew 11% to $3.9 billion, or 12% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $17.3 billion. North America segment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin, compared with $733 million in the prior year period. North America segment operating income includes $6 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the international segment, revenue grew 12% to $11.8 billion. Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 3% to $3.3 billion, or increased 5% excluding foreign exchange.
EGM revenue grew 19% to $8.5 billion, or 31% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating income was $60 million, compared with $65 million in the prior year. International segment operating income includes $47 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the Amazon web services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion. Amazon web services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior year period. AWS segment operating income includes $60 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income was $1.8 billion or 4.9% of revenue, up approximately 140 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $20 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 88% to $1.1 billion. Our income tax expense was $453 million. GAAP net income was $482 million or $1 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $214 million and $0.45 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $107 billion, or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $63.7 billion, or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. International revenue grew 6% to $35.4 billion, or 21% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
Excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, Germany revenue grew 18%. Japan revenue grew 19%, and UK revenue grew 16%. AWS revenue grew 70% to $7.9 billion.
Consolidated segment operating income was $4.5 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $16 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion, compared with $178 million in the prior year.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $19.8 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 billion. And inventory turns were 8.5, down from 8.6 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $20.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 77 from 73 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy, and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, recording further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
For Q1 2016, we expect net sales of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion, or growth of between 17% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $100 million and $700 million, compared with $255 million in first quarter of 2015.
This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses net. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense net, to be between $700 million and $1.3 billion, compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 2015.
We are grateful to our customers, and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first, is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.

Media revenue grew 11% to $3.9 billion, or 12% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $17.3 billion. North America segment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin, compared with $733 million in the prior year period. North America segment operating income includes $6 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.\nIn the international segment, revenue grew 12% to $11.8 billion. Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 3% to $3.3 billion, or increased 5% excluding foreign exchange.\nEGM revenue grew 19% to $8.5 billion, or 31% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating income was $60 million, compared with $65 million in the prior year. International segment operating income includes $47 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.\nIn the Amazon web services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion. Amazon web services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior year period. AWS segment operating income includes $60 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income was $1.8 billion or 4.9% of revenue, up approximately 140 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $20 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.\nUnlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 88% to $1.1 billion. Our income tax expense was $453 million. GAAP net income was $482 million or $1 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $214 million and $0.45 per diluted share.\nNow I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $107 billion, or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $63.7 billion, or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. International revenue grew 6% to $35.4 billion, or 21% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.\nExcluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, Germany revenue grew 18%. Japan revenue grew 19%, and UK revenue grew 16%. AWS revenue grew 70% to $7.9 billion.\nConsolidated segment operating income was $4.5 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $16 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion, compared with $178 million in the prior year.\nTurning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $19.8 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 billion. And inventory turns were 8.5, down from 8.6 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $20.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 77 from 73 in the prior year.\nI'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy, and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.\nAs we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, recording further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.\nFor Q1 2016, we expect net sales of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion, or growth of between 17% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $100 million and $700 million, compared with $255 million in first quarter of 2015.\nThis includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses net. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense net, to be between $700 million and $1.3 billion, compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 2015.\nWe are grateful to our customers, and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first, is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPhil Hardin,  Amazon.com Inc - Director of IR    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          \n          Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\n\n\n================================================================================\nQuestions and Answers\n================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          \n          (Operator Instructions)\nThank you. Our first question is coming from analyst, Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStephen Ju,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          \n          Okay, thanks. So Brian, I think in the past, you've given some indication as to what usage growth may be at AWS. I was wondering if you have an update for that in the fourth quarter? And secondarily, is there any way to characterize what the pricing environment is right now for AWS as well? Thank you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc - CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          \n          Yes, thanks, Stephen. No, I don't have a usage growth number for you. We'll say we're -- it's been very strong. AWS revenue is on a -- just short of a $10 billion run rate at the end of Q4.\nAs far as pricing is concerned, we had a price reduction in January for our EC2 services. It was our 51st price reduction since we launched AWS years ago. And generally, what we find is that price is important, but so is speed and agility for customers, and the ability to deliver services and features that are beneficial to them. I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015, and that was up 40% year-over-year. So we feel we have a lead in this space. And we don't take it for granted, and we want to serve customers better each year.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStephen Ju,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          \n          Thank you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          \n          Thank you. Our next question is from analyst, Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJason Helfstein,  Oppenheimer & Co. - Analyst    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          \n          Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics in fourth quarter, eCommerce, particularly in the US? Did we see more aggressive promotional act""}","Amazon.com Inc released its Q4 2015 financial results, reporting strong growth in key metrics. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion, while trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion. Revenue for the quarter increased by 22% to $35.7 billion, or 26% excluding the $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.

The company's North America segment saw revenue growth of 24% to $21.5 billion, while the International segment had revenue growth of 12% to $11.8 billion. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment had the highest growth, with revenue increasing by 69% to $2.4 billion. AWS segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin.

Amazon's active customer accounts reached approximately 304 million globally, with paid Prime members increasing by 51% year-over-year. The company also reported that worldwide paid unit growth was 26%, while paid Amazon web services customers exceeded 1 million.

Operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, accounted for 27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment accounted for $4.4 billion or 12.3% of revenue, compared to 11.3% in the prior year. Marketing expenses decreased to $1.7 billion or 4.8% of revenue, compared to 5.1% in the previous year.

Looking ahead, Amazon provided guidance for Q1 2016, with net sales expected to be between $26.5 billion and $29 billion, representing growth of 17% to 28%. GAAP operating income is expected to be between $100 million and $700 million, including approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses. Consolidated segment operating income is projected to be between $700 million and $1.3 billion, excluding stock-based compensation and other operating expenses.

Overall, Amazon's strong financial performance reflects its continued focus on driving a better customer experience and the success of its various business segments, especially AWS.",gpt-3

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,   -     [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 1, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
I'd also like to update you on the impact of the recent U.S. tax reform legislation. In our fourth quarter results, we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the new tax legislation of approximately $789 million, which is primarily driven by the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities, resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. As we complete our analysis of this new legislation, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I'd like to focus on the North American retail operating margins. That 4.5% was the highest, I think, we've seen in a couple of years, maybe the highest since you've actually broken that segment out. So could you just go through the drivers behind that? I know you called out Alexa as being better than expected. Was that one of the factors? Was it the full quarter of the Whole Foods impact? Was it advertising revenue? Just what drove that result and how sustainable is it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Mark. Let me address your question by answering the entire company. I'll note where the North America elements are strongest. So for the quarter, we came in at the highest end of our revenue range, $60.5 billion, 26 -- 36% FX-neutral growth and 25% FX-neutral growth, excluding the Whole Foods acquisition. So the fact that we came in at the high end of the range, volume was high, especially in North America, and a lot of times in Q4 and other quarters actually, we see better efficiencies when the warehouses are busy. So it was very clean operational quarter, I would say. The ops team did a great job handling record volumes in Q4 and also incorporating all the new capacity we had opened in 2017. If you remember, we have added over 30% to our fulfillment square footage in 2017, coming off a similar increase in 2016. So amid all these opening of new buildings, many of them late in the year, the ops team did a fantastic job. Advertising was also a key contributor as we're continuing to make more value -- the offerings more valuable, both to customers and advertisers alike, and that was particularly strong in North America. Although not in the North America segment, I would also point out, AWS had a strong quarter, accelerating growth versus Q3 and also expanding operating margins by 100 basis points. So particularly in North America, I would say it was the -- the strong volume -- top line volume, combined with increased advertising revenues and also a very clean operational performance. Obviously, there's a lot of things that can happen in Q4 from weather to demand patterns changing. We've seen additional costs creep in, in the name of customer experience in prior years. And this was, in hindsight, probably one of the cleaner Q4s recently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Brian, I was hoping you could talk about how you're thinking about your primary investment areas in 2018 and perhaps if you could put it in context of '17. Are there things that are notably different this year relative to last year and also how you would think about the margin trajectory relative to what we saw last year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. I -- we'll be giving you guidance quarter by quarter, but I can talk to the general trends in the large investment areas. Let me start with AWS infrastructure and growth in technical and sales teams. That will continue. We're in a $20 billion run rate in top line revenues for AWS, up from 18% -- excuse me, $18 billion last quarter. So we're very happy with the -- both the progression in new services and features that we've been able to bring to customers and also their response. We'll continue geographic expansion and continuing to, again, build on our tech teams and our sales teams. So that would -- that expense is going to continue and likely increase. Prime benefits will continue to increase as well. Prime Now -- excuse me, Prime Video, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all of our major Prime benefits we continue to expand globally. Devices, as Jeff said in the press release, we are very happy with the results of Alexa. It's a very positive surprise for us, both on a -- adding a little bit more to that, we had record device sales, we had very high levels of customer engagement, including increased levels of voice shopping, growth in functionality, growth in our partner -- partners we work with. Skills there, we've increased rapidly. We're over 30,000 skills for Alexa. We've got 4,000-plus smart home devices from 1,200 unique brands. So the -- the relationships we're having with external companies is actually helping to accelerate the adoption of Alexa with customers. So really strong usage of -- excuse me, Alexa with our devices. Obviously, Echo, Echo Show and the Echo family all directly tied to Alexa, but also Fire TV and tablets. And we're seeing more and more engagement. Alexa usage on Fire TV is up 9x year-over-year. Music listening time on Alexa was 3x higher this holiday season. So that's what we mean when we said far exceeding our expectations. Those are the things I would point to. And that is an area, again, where we'll continue to invest heavily and as we say, double down on that. Fulfillment, again, is -- fulfillment capacity, especially to fuel the strong top line growth and growth in Amazon fulfilled units, which, again, is growing much quicker than our unit growth rate, we expect that and hope that to continue as well into 2018. Video content, we spoke about on the last call, we do like the results we're seeing with engagement on customers, their buying habits, their engagement with the video content, their use of it on devices. And we will continue to increase our budget in that area. But I'll be release -- yes, I'll incorporate that into the guidance each quarter as we move through the year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Adam Sandler,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - MD of the Americas Equity Research and Senior Internet Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hey guys, just 2 questions. AWS reaccelerated again this quarter. Can you just give us some color on what were the key drivers there? Was it lapping some of the price activity from a year ago? Was it higher utilization, moving up the stack? Any color there would be helpful. And then a question on shipping costs. So it looks like it grew about 31% up on shipping costs in the quarter, and that's been kind of moving in tandem with the Amazon fulfilled unit growth. Is that the right way to think about it? It looks like it might be getting a little bit of leverage in the model right now as -- is that -- what's driving that, the shipping cost leverage?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Let me start with that last one. Yes, shipping costs are going to be very tied to AFN unit growth and also the impact of greater Prime adoption and faster shipping methods. So yes, we consider that a very strong quarter, down sequentially in the growth that we've seen recently. That will fluctuate quarter to quarter. Again, it was a very strong operational quarter in Q4, and we've expanded the number of items that shipped free. We're now over 100 million items in the U.S. So yes, shipping cost is always going to be a strong part of our offering, and we're -- it's going to be increasing due to our business model. And we, at the same time, look to minimize the cost by getting more and more efficient in that area. AWS, yes, if you remember last year, we did have price increases in December of last year towards the end. So it had a partial impact on the quarter. But generally, just strong usage growth. Usage growth continues to be strong, growing at a higher rate than our revenue growth rate and customers continue to add workloads and expand. And as I said, we're adding new services and features all the time, over 1,400 in 2017 alone. So it's a number of factors, I would say. It's not as simple as lapping a cost there -- excuse me, a price decrease last year, but very happy with the performance in -- of the AWS business. Now over a $20 billion run rate.

And this was, in hindsight, probably one of the cleaner Q4s recently.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDouglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Brian, I was hoping you could talk about how you're thinking about your primary investment areas in 2018 and perhaps if you could put it in context of '17. Are there things that are notably different this year relative to last year and also how you would think about the margin trajectory relative to what we saw last year?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. I -- we'll be giving you guidance quarter by quarter, but I can talk to the general trends in the large investment areas. Let me start with AWS infrastructure and growth in technical and sales teams. That will continue. We're in a $20 billion run rate in top line revenues for AWS, up from 18% -- excuse me, $18 billion last quarter. So we're very happy with the -- both the progression in new services and features that we've been able to bring to customers and also their response. We'll continue geographic expansion and continuing to, again, build on our tech teams and our sales teams. So that would -- that expense is going to continue and likely increase. Prime benefits will continue to increase as well. Prime Now -- excuse me, Prime Video, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all of our major Prime benefits we continue to expand globally. Devices, as Jeff said in the press release, we are very happy with the results of Alexa. It's a very positive surprise for us, both on a -- adding a little bit more to that, we had record device sales, we had very high levels of customer engagement, including increased levels of voice shopping, growth in functionality, growth in our partner -- partners we work with. Skills there, we've increased rapidly. We're over 30,000 skills for Alexa. We've got 4,000-plus smart home devices from 1,200 unique brands. So the -- the relationships we're having with external companies is actually helping to accelerate the adoption of Alexa with customers. So really strong usage of -- excuse me, Alexa with our devices. Obviously, Echo, Echo Show and the Echo family all directly tied to Alexa, but also Fire TV and tablets. And we're seeing more and more engagement. Alexa usage on Fire TV is up 9x year-over-year. Music listening time on Alexa was 3x higher this holiday season. So that's what we mean when we said far exceeding our expectations. Those are the things I would point to. And that is an area, again, where we'll continue to invest heavily and as we say, double down on that. Fulfillment, again, is -- fulfillment capacity, especially to fuel the strong top line growth and growth in Amazon fulfilled units, which, again, is growing much quicker than our unit growth rate, we expect that and hope that to continue as well into 2018. Video content, we spoke about on the last call, we do like the results we're seeing with engagement on customers, their buying habits, their engagement with the video content, their use of it on devices. And we will continue to increase our budget in that area. But I'll be release -- yes, I'll incorporate that into the guidance each quarter as we move through the year.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRoss Adam Sandler,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - MD of the Americas Equity Research and Senior Internet Analyst    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Hey guys, just 2 questions. AWS reaccelerated again this quarter. Can you just give us some color on what were the key drivers there? Was it lapping some of the price activity from a year ago? Was it higher utilization, moving up the stack? Any color there would be helpful. And then a question on shipping costs. So it looks like it grew about 31% up on shipping costs in the quarter, and that's been kind of moving in tandem with the Amazon fulfilled unit growth. Is that the right way to think about it? It looks like it might be getting a little bit of leverage in the model right now as -- is that -- what's driving that, the shipping cost leverage?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. Let me start with that last one. Yes, shipping costs are going to be very tied to AFN unit growth and also the impact of greater Prime adoption and faster shipping methods. So yes, we consider that a very strong quarter, down sequentially in the growth that we've seen recently. That will fluctuate quarter to quarter. Again, it was a very strong operational quarter in Q4, and we've expanded the number of items that shipped free. We're now over 100 million items in the U.S. So yes, shipping cost is always going to be a strong part of our offering, and we're -- it's going to be increasing due to our business model. And we, at the same time, look to minimize the cost by getting more and more efficient in that area. AWS, yes, if you remember last year, we did have price increases in December of last year towards the end. So it had a partial impact on the quarter. But generally, just strong usage growth. Usage growth continues to be strong, growing at a higher rate than our revenue growth rate and customers continue to add workloads and expand. And as I said, we're adding new services and features all the time, over 1,400 in 2017 alone. So it's a number of factors, I would say. It's not as simple as lapping a cost there -- excuse me, a price decrease last year, but very happy with the performance in -- of the AWS business. Now over a $20 billion run rate.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [1""}","Amazon.com Inc.'s Q4 2017 earnings call revealed several key insights into the company's performance and strategic direction. Below is a synthesis based on the qualitative and quantitative data from the transcript:

**Revenue Performance and Drivers**
- The company reported $60.5 billion in revenue, marking a 36% FX-neutral growth and 25% FX-neutral growth excluding the Whole Foods acquisition.
- High sales volume, particularly in North America, played a significant role, with operational efficiency cited during a busy Q4.
- Advertising emerged as a significant revenue driver, contributing more to the top line, especially in North America.
- The AWS sector reached a $20 billion run rate, accelerating growth from the previous quarter and expressing a 100-basis-point expansion in operating margins.

**Investment Areas and Operating Costs**
- AWS: Investment in infrastructure, tech, and sales teams is anticipated to continue and likely increase.
- Prime Benefits: Continued global expansion of Prime Video, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, and other Prime-related services is expected.
- Devices and Alexa: After a period of high device sales and customer engagement, the company plans to further invest in Alexa's development.
- Fulfillment: Fulfillment capacity will expand to sustain strong top-line growth and Amazon fulfilled units' growth.
- Video Content: The video content budget will increase, and changes in expenditure will be updated quarterly.

**Margins and Efficiency**
- North American retail operating margins reached a notable 4.5%, driven by volume efficiencies, advertising revenue, and smooth operational performance.
- The integration of Alexa into devices led to higher customer engagement, including a ninefold increase in Alexa use on Fire TV.

**Shipping Costs**
- Shipping costs grew by 31%, closely associated with the growth in Amazon fulfilled units and Prime adoption.
- The company aims to increase efficiency in shipping to minimize costs while expanding free shipping items, now over 100 million in the U.S.

**Future Guidance and Assumptions**
- The guidance provided is based on current order trends and what the company believes to be appropriate assumptions.
- It is stated that guidance assumes no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements.
- The impact of unforeseeable factors such as demand for goods and services, economic conditions, and world events could materially affect actual results.
- The company has recorded a provisional tax benefit of approximately $789 million due to the U.S. tax reform legislation, with potential adjustments to the provisional amounts that may affect income taxes in future periods.

**Macro and Miscellaneous Elements**
- The company acknowledged inherent unpredictability in results, influenced by factors like foreign exchange rates, global economic conditions, customer spending trends, growth rates of the internet and online commerce, and other SEC-detailed elements.
- There was no explicit forward guidance on EBITDA, capital structure, debt, free cash flow, or liquidity detailed in the transcript.

The above points encapsulate Amazon's performance in Q4 2017, highlighting key business drivers and areas of strategic investment, while also acknowledging potential volatility and the impact of a changing macroeconomic and regulatory environment.",gpt-4

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,   -     [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 1, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
I'd also like to update you on the impact of the recent U.S. tax reform legislation. In our fourth quarter results, we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the new tax legislation of approximately $789 million, which is primarily driven by the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities, resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. As we complete our analysis of this new legislation, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I'd like to focus on the North American retail operating margins. That 4.5% was the highest, I think, we've seen in a couple of years, maybe the highest since you've actually broken that segment out. So could you just go through the drivers behind that? I know you called out Alexa as being better than expected. Was that one of the factors? Was it the full quarter of the Whole Foods impact? Was it advertising revenue? Just what drove that result and how sustainable is it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Mark. Let me address your question by answering the entire company. I'll note where the North America elements are strongest. So for the quarter, we came in at the highest end of our revenue range, $60.5 billion, 26 -- 36% FX-neutral growth and 25% FX-neutral growth, excluding the Whole Foods acquisition. So the fact that we came in at the high end of the range, volume was high, especially in North America, and a lot of times in Q4 and other quarters actually, we see better efficiencies when the warehouses are busy. So it was very clean operational quarter, I would say. The ops team did a great job handling record volumes in Q4 and also incorporating all the new capacity we had opened in 2017. If you remember, we have added over 30% to our fulfillment square footage in 2017, coming off a similar increase in 2016. So amid all these opening of new buildings, many of them late in the year, the ops team did a fantastic job. Advertising was also a key contributor as we're continuing to make more value -- the offerings more valuable, both to customers and advertisers alike, and that was particularly strong in North America. Although not in the North America segment, I would also point out, AWS had a strong quarter, accelerating growth versus Q3 and also expanding operating margins by 100 basis points. So particularly in North America, I would say it was the -- the strong volume -- top line volume, combined with increased advertising revenues and also a very clean operational performance. Obviously, there's a lot of things that can happen in Q4 from weather to demand patterns changing. We've seen additional costs creep in, in the name of customer experience in prior years. And this was, in hindsight, probably one of the cleaner Q4s recently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Brian, I was hoping you could talk about how you're thinking about your primary investment areas in 2018 and perhaps if you could put it in context of '17. Are there things that are notably different this year relative to last year and also how you would think about the margin trajectory relative to what we saw last year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. I -- we'll be giving you guidance quarter by quarter, but I can talk to the general trends in the large investment areas. Let me start with AWS infrastructure and growth in technical and sales teams. That will continue. We're in a $20 billion run rate in top line revenues for AWS, up from 18% -- excuse me, $18 billion last quarter. So we're very happy with the -- both the progression in new services and features that we've been able to bring to customers and also their response. We'll continue geographic expansion and continuing to, again, build on our tech teams and our sales teams. So that would -- that expense is going to continue and likely increase. Prime benefits will continue to increase as well. Prime Now -- excuse me, Prime Video, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all of our major Prime benefits we continue to expand globally. Devices, as Jeff said in the press release, we are very happy with the results of Alexa. It's a very positive surprise for us, both on a -- adding a little bit more to that, we had record device sales, we had very high levels of customer engagement, including increased levels of voice shopping, growth in functionality, growth in our partner -- partners we work with.

          Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Adam Sandler,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - MD of the Americas Equity Research and Senior Internet Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That will continue. We're in a $20 billion run rate in top line revenues for AWS, up from 18% -- excuse me, $18 billion last quarter. So we're very happy with the -- both the progression in new services and features that we've been able to bring to customers and also their response. We'll continue geographic expansion and continuing to, again, build on our tech teams and our sales teams. So that would -- that expense is going to continue and likely increase. Prime benefits will continue to increase as well. Prime Now -- excuse me, Prime Video, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all of our major Prime benefits we continue to expand globally. Devices, as Jeff said in the press release, we are very happy with the results of Alexa. It's a very positive surprise for us, both on a -- adding a little bit more to that, we had record device sales, we had very high levels of customer engagement, including increased levels of voice shopping, growth in functionality, growth in our partner -- partners we work with. Skills there, we've increased rapidly. We're over 30,000 skills for Alexa. We've got 4,000-plus smart home devices from 1,200 unique brands. So the -- the relationships we're having with external companies is actually helping to accelerate the adoption of Alexa with customers. So really strong usage of -- excuse me, Alexa with our devices. Obviously, Echo, Echo Show and the Echo family all directly tied to Alexa, but also Fire TV and tablets. And we're seeing more and more engagement. Alexa usage on Fire TV is up 9x year-over-year. Music listening time on Alexa was 3x higher this holiday season. So that's what we mean when we said far exceeding our expectations. Those are the things I would point to. And that is an area, again, where we'll continue to invest heavily and as we say, double down on that. Fulfillment, again, is -- fulfillment capacity, especially to fuel the strong top line growth and growth in Amazon fulfilled units, which, again, is growing much quicker than our unit growth rate, we expect that and hope that to continue as well into 2018. Video content, we spoke about on the last call, we do like the results we're seeing with engagement on customers, their buying habits, their engagement with the video content, their use of it on devices. And we will continue to increase our budget in that area. But I'll be release -- yes, I'll incorporate that into the guidance each quarter as we move through the year.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRoss Adam Sandler,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - MD of the Americas Equity Research and Senior Internet Analyst    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Hey guys, just 2 questions. AWS reaccelerated again this quarter. Can you just give us some color on what were the key drivers there? Was it lapping some of the price activity from a year ago? Was it higher utilization, moving up the stack? Any color there would be helpful. And then a question on shipping costs. So it looks like it grew about 31% up on shipping costs in the quarter, and that's been kind of moving in tandem with the Amazon fulfilled unit growth. Is that the right way to think about it? It looks like it might be getting a little bit of leverage in the model right now as -- is that -- what's driving that, the shipping cost leverage?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. Let me start with that last one. Yes, shipping costs are going to be very tied to AFN unit growth and also the impact of greater Prime adoption and faster shipping methods. So yes, we consider that a very strong quarter, down sequentially in the growth that we've seen recently. That will fluctuate quarter to quarter. Again, it was a very strong operational quarter in Q4, and we've expanded the number of items that shipped free. We're now over 100 million items in the U.S. So yes, shipping cost is always going to be a strong part of our offering, and we're -- it's going to be increasing due to our business model. And we, at the same time, look to minimize the cost by getting more and more efficient in that area. AWS, yes, if you remember last year, we did have price increases in December of last year towards the end. So it had a partial impact on the quarter. But generally, just strong usage growth. Usage growth continues to be strong, growing at a higher rate than our revenue growth rate and customers continue to add workloads and expand. And as I said, we're adding new services and features all the time, over 1,400 in 2017 alone. So it's a number of factors, I would say. It's not as simple as lapping a cost there -- excuse me, a price decrease last year, but very happy with the performance in -- of the AWS business. Now over a $20 billion run rate.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [1""}","Key Insights from Amazon.com Q4 2017 Earnings Call:

1. Revenue: Amazon reported revenue of $60.5 billion in Q4 2017, representing a 36% year-over-year growth on a FX-neutral basis. The company exceeded its revenue range and attributed the strong performance to high volume, particularly in North America.

2. North American Retail Operating Margins: Amazon's North American retail operating margins stood at 4.5%, the highest in a couple of years. The company attributed this to strong top-line volume, increased advertising revenues, and efficient operational performance in the busy Q4 period.

3. AWS Growth: Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced strong growth, with revenue reaching a $20 billion run rate, up from $18 billion in the previous quarter. The key drivers of growth were strong usage growth, new services, and features, and continued customer adoption and expansion.

4. Shipping Costs: Shipping costs grew approximately 31% in Q4, in line with the growth of Amazon fulfilled units. The company highlighted that shipping costs are tied to its business model, which includes offering faster and free shipping options. While shipping costs fluctuate each quarter, Amazon aims to minimize these costs through efficiency improvements.

5. Investment Areas in 2018: Amazon outlined its primary investment areas for 2018, which include AWS infrastructure and expansion, Prime benefits (such as Prime Now and AmazonFresh), Alexa devices and functionalities, fulfillment capacity, and video content. The company plans to continue investing heavily in these areas to drive growth and customer engagement.

6. Forward Guidance: Amazon provided guidance on a quarter-by-quarter basis but highlighted some general trends. The company expects investments in AWS, Prime benefits, devices, fulfillment capacity, and video content to continue in 2018. While specific margin trajectory details were not provided, Amazon emphasized its focus on operational efficiency and cost minimization.

7. U.S. Tax Reform Impact: Amazon recorded a provisional tax benefit of approximately $789 million in Q4 2017 due to the new U.S. tax reform legislation. The company noted that adjustments to the provisional amounts may be made as further analysis is completed, potentially impacting the provision for income taxes in future periods.

8. Financial Disclosures: Amazon mentioned that it may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Additional disclosures and reconciliations of these measures with GAAP measures can be found in the company's press release and SEC filings. The company also acknowledged that its results are inherently unpredictable and may be affected by various factors mentioned in its SEC filings.

Overall, Amazon's Q4 2017 performance was driven by strong revenue growth, particularly in North America, and the continued success of AWS. The company plans to continue investing in key growth areas while focusing on operational efficiency and cost management. The impact of the U.S. tax reform legislation was also highlighted as a factor to be considered in future financial results.",gpt-3

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2020 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, David Fildes. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by thanking and recognizing the contributions of hundreds of thousands of Amazon employees and delivery partners and hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses who are working hard to serve our customers all around the world in these uncertain times.
Amazon's second quarter was another highly unusual quarter. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we began to see a significant increase in customer demand beginning in early March, and demand remained elevated throughout Q2. Strong early demand in groceries and consumable products continued into Q2, while demand increased during the quarter in our other major product categories like hardlines and softlines.
At the same time, we continue to focus on stepped up employee safety, particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations, to help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. In Q2, we incurred more than $4 billion of COVID-related expenses, getting products to customers and keeping employees safe. The largest portion of these costs related to compensation for our frontline employees, including higher hourly wages through the end of May and a more than $500 million Thank You bonus in June.
We also experienced productivity headwinds in our facilities. This included changes to over 150 of our processes to provide for social distancing as well as costs to onboard and train over 175,000 new employees who are hired to meet the higher customer demand. This $4 billion also included investments in personal protective equipment for employees and enhanced cleaning for our facilities.
Our consolidated revenue and operating income significantly exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Strong top line performance was driven by increased consumer demand, led by Prime members. We continue to see high Prime member engagement throughout the quarter. Prime members shop more often with larger basket sizes. Worldwide streaming video hours doubled year-over-year driven largely by Prime video. We're reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. Online grocery sales tripled year-over-year. Existing Prime member renewal rates improved, and the Prime member growth rate accelerated both in the U.S. and worldwide.
Our 3P sellers, who are largely comprised of small and medium-sized businesses, also stepped up to help make more selection available for customers. And as a result, these small and medium-sized businesses have seen significant growth in their sales.
Our third-party seller services revenue grew faster than online stores revenue in Q2, with strong growth in both fulfillment by Amazon and merchant fulfilled or MFN seller sales. Third-party units continue to represent more than half of overall unit volume, helped by improved quarter-over-quarter growth in active sellers.
We are more committed than ever to supporting the success of the hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses to sell their products in Amazon stores. We were able to meet this heightened demand because we were also able to open up more fulfillment network capacity as the quarter progressed with faster delivery across more selection.
I'd point to a few capacity improvements that have allowed us to enhance throughput. First, our regular headcount grew 34% year-over-year as of the end of Q2 and continues to grow. We welcomed more than 175,000 new employees in March and April, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy. As we've seen demand remain high, we are in the process of bringing 125,000 of these employees into regular full-time positions.
I would also note that Amazon has created more jobs over the last decade than any other company, and we are proud that we're continuing to create good jobs with industry-leading wages and great benefits during this challenging time. Our combined number of regular and seasonal employees is currently over 1 million.
We've also been able to expand the output in our existing facilities as we've had time to implement, learn and iterate on the new process paths we put in place. Additionally, as a reminder, Q2 is typically our lightest volume quarter for the retail business. That's not the case this year, but what that's meant is that we can flex into space normally used for second half peak demand. This led to strong operating leverage in Q2. As we move towards peak in the second half of the year, we will ramp up our space needs even further, and we'll be adding significant fulfillment center and transportation capacity in the second half of the year.
Turning to AWS. This is now a $43 billion annualized run rate business, up nearly $10 billion in run rate in the last 12 months. Customer usage remains strong, although growth varies across industries as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.
Lastly, I'll touch upon our Q3 guidance, which we provided as part of our earnings release. A few additional data points on this guidance. We expect to incur more than $2 billion in COVID-related expenses in Q3 to help keep employees safe, including continued investment in social distancing, PP&E and testing. Costs are expected to be lower than in Q2 primarily due to better cost efficiency at the high demand levels we are seeing.
In addition, I'll remind you that the third quarter is typically when we open the majority of our new fulfillment network capacity, and we expect the same this year. We continue to invest meaningfully, including $9.4 billion in CapEx and finance leases in Q2 alone, an increase of 65% year-over-year, primarily driven by investments in our fulfillment and logistics footprint. Once these buildings open, they are a headwind to profitability as they ramp up and we prepare for Q4 peak.
In 2019, we increased network square footage by approximately 15%. This year, we expect a meaningfully higher year-over-year square footage growth of approximately 50%. This includes strong growth in new fulfillment center space as well as sort centers and delivery stations. We expect the majority of this capacity to come online in late Q3 and into Q4.
Lastly, we plan to host Prime Day in Q4 this year rather than Q3 as it has been in prior years. The one exception is Amazon India, which will host Prime Day on August 6 and August 7.
In summary, we know that people are relying on online shopping more than ever during this unprecedented time, and we are working hard to add capacity to serve customers. We're extremely grateful to our employees across Amazon for continuously stepping up to meet the needs of customers.
With that, let's move on to Q&A.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Maybe I could just dive in on the normalized trends you're seeing as you exit June and get into July. You made a push into essentials and deemphasized nonessentials, as we talked about in the last earnings call. Where are we in terms of the company getting the mix between essentials versus nonessentials right in terms of offering to customers? Where are you in terms of returning to normal on next-day and 2-day shipping initiatives to drive Prime? If there was any color on the state of affairs with either of those by geo or region of the world, that would be great.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Eric. Thanks for your question. So first, on the trend. So if you remember, we exited Q1 and spoke at the end of April. We had taken a lot of steps in March and April to, first, limit the incoming nonessential products into our warehouses, and then we reversed that or eliminated that decision in mid-April.
So we started to normalize on our channel mix. And I would say, as we moved into late April and early May, we expected that because a lot of the sellers can toggle between MFN or FBA sales that we would see MFN drop as FBA picked up. But to a large extent, MFN remained strong even as FBA picked up. So we had a very favorable mix, if you will, coming from March on. It started to normalize a little bit more to normal levels towards the end of the quarter, but MFN still remains high.
On the product side, a lot of what we saw in March and early April was sales of consumables and groceries and safety items. And we talked a lot about the fact that, that was coming at pretty much 0 cost -- or excuse me, 0 profit when you factored in the COVID-related costs. We've got better on our cost structure, and we also resumed a more normal mix in, I'd say, early part of May.
So since then, I would say it's getting closer to what we call a more normal mix. Demand is still super high. What we're seeing on -- it's driven by Prime members and Prime member engagement. They're shopping more often. They have l

We're extremely grateful to our employees across Amazon for continuously stepping up to meet the needs of customers.\nWith that, let's move on to Q&A.\n\n\n================================================================================\nQuestions and Answers\n================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Maybe I could just dive in on the normalized trends you're seeing as you exit June and get into July. You made a push into essentials and deemphasized nonessentials, as we talked about in the last earnings call. Where are we in terms of the company getting the mix between essentials versus nonessentials right in terms of offering to customers? Where are you in terms of returning to normal on next-day and 2-day shipping initiatives to drive Prime? If there was any color on the state of affairs with either of those by geo or region of the world, that would be great.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure, Eric. Thanks for your question. So first, on the trend. So if you remember, we exited Q1 and spoke at the end of April. We had taken a lot of steps in March and April to, first, limit the incoming nonessential products into our warehouses, and then we reversed that or eliminated that decision in mid-April.\nSo we started to normalize on our channel mix. And I would say, as we moved into late April and early May, we expected that because a lot of the sellers can toggle between MFN or FBA sales that we would see MFN drop as FBA picked up. But to a large extent, MFN remained strong even as FBA picked up. So we had a very favorable mix, if you will, coming from March on. It started to normalize a little bit more to normal levels towards the end of the quarter, but MFN still remains high.\nOn the product side, a lot of what we saw in March and early April was sales of consumables and groceries and safety items. And we talked a lot about the fact that, that was coming at pretty much 0 cost -- or excuse me, 0 profit when you factored in the COVID-related costs. We've got better on our cost structure, and we also resumed a more normal mix in, I'd say, early part of May.\nSo since then, I would say it's getting closer to what we call a more normal mix. Demand is still super high. What we're seeing on -- it's driven by Prime members and Prime member engagement. They're shopping more often.

- **Guidance Factors**: The guidance accounts for order trends seen to date and assumptions including the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. It does not include potential new business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements.
  
### Contextual and Qualitative Insights

- The demand is attributed to an increased reliance on online shopping during the pandemic.
- The exceptional revenue and operating income performance significantly exceeded the top end of Amazon's guidance range.
- The performance varies across different product categories, with increasing normalcy returning post-Q1 2020.
- Amazon has adjusted by creating more jobs over the last decade, with a total current employee count of over 1 million, also indicating a response to rising demand.

- **CAPEX Increase**: Q2 investment surged by 65% year-over-year to $9.4 billion.

### Consolidated Themes 

- **Capacity and Infrastructure**: A major theme is Amazon's continued investment to expand capacity and infrastructure to meet high customer demand, including a significant growth in their fulfillment and delivery network.
- **Labor and Safety Investments**: Another theme is the investment in labor, both in terms of hiring new employees and creating safe working conditions, which has led to increased operational costs.
- **Cloud Services Resilience**: AWS persists as a robust and growing segment of Amazon's business, unaffected by the pandemic's impact on other areas.

### Guidance Specifics 

- **Normalization of Operations**: Amazon is working towards returning to usual shipping speeds and mix balance between essential and nonessential goods.
- **COVID-19 Expenses**: Provisioned $2 billion for Q3 expenses related to COVID-19, with the expectation of being more cost-efficient at current demand levels.

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2020 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, David Fildes. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by thanking and recognizing the contributions of hundreds of thousands of Amazon employees and delivery partners and hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses who are working hard to serve our customers all around the world in these uncertain times.
Amazon's second quarter was another highly unusual quarter. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we began to see a significant increase in customer demand beginning in early March, and demand remained elevated throughout Q2. Strong early demand in groceries and consumable products continued into Q2, while demand increased during the quarter in our other major product categories like hardlines and softlines.
At the same time, we continue to focus on stepped up employee safety, particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations, to help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. In Q2, we incurred more than $4 billion of COVID-related expenses, getting products to customers and keeping employees safe. The largest portion of these costs related to compensation for our frontline employees, including higher hourly wages through the end of May and a more than $500 million Thank You bonus in June.
We also experienced productivity headwinds in our facilities. This included changes to over 150 of our processes to provide for social distancing as well as costs to onboard and train over 175,000 new employees who are hired to meet the higher customer demand. This $4 billion also included investments in personal protective equipment for employees and enhanced cleaning for our facilities.
Our consolidated revenue and operating income significantly exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Strong top line performance was driven by increased consumer demand, led by Prime members. We continue to see high Prime member engagement throughout the quarter. Prime members shop more often with larger basket sizes. Worldwide streaming video hours doubled year-over-year driven largely by Prime video. We're reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. Online grocery sales tripled year-over-year. Existing Prime member renewal rates improved, and the Prime member growth rate accelerated both in the U.S. and worldwide.
Our 3P sellers, who are largely comprised of small and medium-sized businesses, also stepped up to help make more selection available for customers. And as a result, these small and medium-sized businesses have seen significant growth in their sales.
Our third-party seller services revenue grew faster than online stores revenue in Q2, with strong growth in both fulfillment by Amazon and merchant fulfilled or MFN seller sales. Third-party units continue to represent more than half of overall unit volume, helped by improved quarter-over-quarter growth in active sellers.
We are more committed than ever to supporting the success of the hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses to sell their products in Amazon stores. We were able to meet this heightened demand because we were also able to open up more fulfillment network capacity as the quarter progressed with faster delivery across more selection.
I'd point to a few capacity improvements that have allowed us to enhance throughput. First, our regular headcount grew 34% year-over-year as of the end of Q2 and continues to grow. We welcomed more than 175,000 new employees in March and April, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy. As we've seen demand remain high, we are in the process of bringing 125,000 of these employees into regular full-time positions.
I would also note that Amazon has created more jobs over the last decade than any other company, and we are proud that we're continuing to create good jobs with industry-leading wages and great benefits during this challenging time. Our combined number of regular and seasonal employees is currently over 1 million.
We've also been able to expand the output in our existing facilities as we've had time to implement, learn and iterate on the new process paths we put in place. Additionally, as a reminder, Q2 is typically our lightest volume quarter for the retail business. That's not the case this year, but what that's meant is that we can flex into space normally used for second half peak demand. This led to strong operating leverage in Q2. As we move towards peak in the second half of the year, we will ramp up our space needs even further, and we'll be adding significant fulfillment center and transportation capacity in the second half of the year.
Turning to AWS. This is now a $43 billion annualized run rate business, up nearly $10 billion in run rate in the last 12 months. Customer usage remains strong, although growth varies across industries as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.
Lastly, I'll touch upon our Q3 guidance, which we provided as part of our earnings release. A few additional data points on this guidance. We expect to incur more than $2 billion in COVID-related expenses in Q3 to help keep employees safe, including continued investment in social distancing, PP&E and testing. Costs are expected to be lower than in Q2 primarily due to better cost efficiency at the high demand levels we are seeing.
In addition, I'll remind you that the third quarter is typically when we open the majority of our new fulfillment network capacity, and we expect the same this year. We continue to invest meaningfully, including $9.4 billion in CapEx and finance leases in Q2 alone, an increase of 65% year-over-year, primarily driven by investments in our fulfillment and logistics footprint. Once these buildings open, they are a headwind to profitability as they ramp up and we prepare for Q4 peak.
In 2019, we increased network square footage by approximately 15%. This year, we expect a meaningfully higher year-over-year square footage growth of approximately 50%. This includes strong growth in new fulfillment center space as well as sort centers and delivery stations. We expect the majority of this capacity to come online in late Q3 and into Q4.
Lastly, we plan to host Prime Day in Q4 this year rather than Q3 as it has been in prior years. The one exception is Amazon India, which will host Prime Day on August 6 and August 7.
In summary, we know that people are relying on online shopping more than ever during this unprecedented time, and we are working hard to add capacity to serve customers. We're extremely grateful to our employees across Amazon for continuously stepping up to meet the needs of customers.
With that, let's move on to Q&A.

Questions and Answers

          (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.

Eric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Maybe I could just dive in on the normalized trends you're seeing as you exit June and get into July. You made a push into essentials and deemphasized nonessentials, as we talked about in the last earnings call. Where are we in terms of the company getting the mix between essentials versus nonessentials right in terms of offering to customers? Where are you in terms of returning to normal on next-day and 2-day shipping initiatives to drive Prime? If there was any color on the state of affairs with either of those by geo or region of the world, that would be great.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Eric. Thanks for your question. So first, on the trend. So if you remember, we exited Q1 and spoke at the end of April. We had taken a lot of steps in March and April to, first, limit the incoming nonessential products into our warehouses, and then we reversed that or eliminated that decision in mid-April.
So we started to normalize on our channel mix. And I would say, as we moved into late April and early May, we expected that because a lot of the sellers can toggle between MFN or FBA sales that we would see MFN drop as FBA picked up. But to a large extent, MFN remained strong even as FBA picked up. So we had a very favorable mix, if you will, coming from March on. It started to normalize a little bit more to normal levels towards the end of the quarter, but MFN still remains high.
On the product side, a lot of what we saw in March and early April was sales of consumables and groceries and safety items. And we talked a lot about the fact that, that was coming at pretty much 0 cost -- or excuse me, 0 profit when you factored in the COVID-related costs. We've got better on our cost structure, and we also resumed a more normal mix in, I'd say, early part of May.
So since then, I would say it's getting closer to what we call a more normal mix. Demand is still super high. What we're seeing on -- it's driven by Prime members and Prime member engagement. They're shopping more often. They have l

We're extremely grateful to our employees across Amazon for continuously stepping up to meet the needs of customers.\nWith that, let's move on to Q&A.\n\n\n================================================================================\nQuestions and Answers\n================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Maybe I could just dive in on the normalized trends you're seeing as you exit June and get into July. You made a push into essentials and deemphasized nonessentials, as we talked about in the last earnings call. Where are we in terms of the company getting the mix between essentials versus nonessentials right in terms of offering to customers? Where are you in terms of returning to normal on next-day and 2-day shipping initiatives to drive Prime? If there was any color on the state of affairs with either of those by geo or region of the world, that would be great.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure, Eric. Thanks for your question. So first, on the trend. So if you remember, we exited Q1 and spoke at the end of April. We had taken a lot of steps in March and April to, first, limit the incoming nonessential products into our warehouses, and then we reversed that or eliminated that decision in mid-April.\nSo we started to normalize on our channel mix. And I would say, as we moved into late April and early May, we expected that because a lot of the sellers can toggle between MFN or FBA sales that we would see MFN drop as FBA picked up. But to a large extent, MFN remained strong even as FBA picked up. So we had a very favorable mix, if you will, coming from March on. It started to normalize a little bit more to normal levels towards the end of the quarter, but MFN still remains high.\nOn the product side, a lot of what we saw in March and early April was sales of consumables and groceries and safety items. And we talked a lot about the fact that, that was coming at pretty much 0 cost -- or excuse me, 0 profit when you factored in the COVID-related costs. We've got better on our cost structure, and we also resumed a more normal mix in, I'd say, early part of May.\nSo since then, I would say it's getting closer to what we call a more normal mix. Demand is still super high. What we're seeing on -- it's driven by Prime members and Prime member engagement. They're shopping more often. They have l""}","- In Q2 2020, Amazon experienced a significant increase in customer demand, with strong early demand in groceries and consumable products, as well as increased demand in other major product categories like hardlines and softlines.
- The company incurred over $4 billion in COVID-related expenses in Q2, including compensation for frontline employees, productivity headwinds in facilities, and investments in employee safety measures.
- Consolidated revenue and operating income exceeded the top end of guidance, driven by increased consumer demand, particularly from Prime members.
- Prime member engagement remained high, with Prime members shopping more often and larger basket sizes. Worldwide streaming video hours doubled year-over-year, and online grocery sales tripled year-over-year.
- Third-party seller services revenue grew faster than online stores revenue, with strong growth in fulfillment by Amazon and merchant fulfilled seller sales. Third-party units represent more than half of overall unit volume.
- Amazon plans to bring in 125,000 hired employees into regular full-time positions.
- AWS is a $43 billion annualized run rate business, with strong customer usage, although growth varies across industries due to the COVID-19 crisis.
- Q3 guidance includes more than $2 billion in COVID-related expenses, with costs expected to be lower than Q2 due to better cost efficiency. Amazon will open the majority of its new fulfillment network capacity in Q3 and plans to host Prime Day in Q4.
- The company expects a meaningfully higher year-over-year square footage growth of approximately 50% in new fulfillment center space, sort centers, and delivery stations, with the majority of this capacity coming online in late Q3 and Q4.

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shelly Kay Pfeiffer,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 25, 2019, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet; online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have 2. It looks like the overall retail business accelerated pretty nicely in the quarter. Maybe could you just talk about whether 24-hour shipping is driving that? And if so which specific categories of consumption are you seeing really drive that acceleration? And then sort of the opposite question on AWS which has slowed down a little bit, can you just talk about some of the puts and takes in the AWS revenue growth this quarter versus the prior Q?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Brian. Thanks for your questions. Let me start with AWS. We had a really strong quarter. We had a growth year-over-year in our run rate from $24 billion to $33 billion, so 37% growth. The $9 billion that we increased our run rate by was second only to Q4 of last year as far as our history. So as you can tell, we've been pretty transparent with our AWS revenue and income numbers, we've been breaking it out since 2015. And we're very happy with the growth in absolute dollar terms, we're seeing the pickup from customers and their usage, their increased pace of enterprise migrations, increased adoption of our services, especially our machine learning services. And continually, again, AWS is being chosen as a partner to many companies because of our leadership position both in technology, our vibrant partner ecosystem and also the stronger security that we offer.
On your question about one-day, let me update you on that because obviously that was a big topic of conversation last quarter, and you can see that it's starting to show up in our results in Q2. So we are really pleased with the customer response to our growing one-day offering. In Q2, we had a meaningful step-up in the one-day shipments, primarily in North America. And volume was -- one-day volume was accelerating throughout the quarter. The ops team did a fantastic job here, not only being able to expand one-day selection and delivery capacity, but also preparing for and handling some very high volumes on Prime Day earlier in the month.
So we're in the middle of a journey here. We expect to see a continued ramp of the one-day selection and availability for the next few quarters both in North America and international. International was up slightly in Q2, but for the most part, the improvement in delivery speeds will be, in future quarters, there. On the cost side, we talked last time about $800 million estimate of transportation cost to supply one-day -- the addition of one-day in Q2. We were a little bit higher than that number in total cost. We saw some additional transition costs in our warehouses. We saw some lower productivity as we were expanding rather quickly both local capacity and the off-season also in our delivery networks. We also saw some costs for moving -- buying more inventory and moving inventory around in our network to have it be closer to the customers. And we built that, not only that cost structure, but an accelerating cost penalty into our Q3 guidance that was released with our earnings today.
And as I said in another setting, we've seen this before. We have had large changes to our distribution and transportation network repeatedly in our history, from going from media to a vast variety of different product lines, hardlines, nonsortable as we call them, the initial 2-day Prime shipping offer that we launched many years ago, the great expansion of our network to include FBA merchants and capacity for them and more recently, the first steps to increase one-day and same-day, although on a much smaller scale. So it does create a shock to the system. We're working through that now, and we expect we'll be working through that for a number of quarters. But when the dust settles, we will regain our cost efficiency over time.
As far as you asked about specific product lines, nothing really to share there. We have seen lower ASP generally in Q2, higher unit growth versus revenue growth in North America, and we -- could be that we are mixing into some lower ASP items as we launch one-day, but we haven't drawn that total conclusion yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heath Patrick Terry,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just wondering back on the AWS side of things, can you give us a sense of sort of what you're seeing from a volume perspective? Obviously, price is always a big component of growth in this, but just trying to understand whether or not you're seeing similar trends in terms of growth rate deceleration on the volume side of things. And then to the extent that we're sort of thinking about the mix of either revenue or usage within that business, are there any products or sort of product areas, AI obviously being one that's been a major initiative for you, that you're seeing particular either outside growth or under growth relative to the overall business that you would call out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, sure. On that second point, I'd say we're seeing a lot of increased adoption in machine learning services, especially Amazon SageMaker. We've had tens of thousands of customers who are now using AWS machine learning services, and we'll continue to innovate on behalf of those customers and released more than 200 machine learning features and capabilities in 2018 alone in this area. Database is also a multibillion-dollar business propelled by Aurora. So we're seeing a lot of strength. We're seeing strong usage growth that outpaces revenue growth as usual, increased pace of enterprise migrations. So I would say that, on a percentage growth basis, again, on a dollar basis, it's growing very strongly. On a percentage growth basis, we are lapping some very strong growth in the first half of last year. We were growing about 50% in the first half of last year, and there are some particular unique customer volumes that were flowing through that, some customers have really high usage tied to their businesses. But for the most part, we continue to grow usage and our expansion of our services with all of our customers. So very happy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. Couple of questions. I guess the first question is just what happens with customer behavior when they do have one-day availability? I'm assuming units go up, but can you give us any details on what happens or a category that switches to one-day, what happens?
And the second question, we've heard from some of our checks that some of the smaller merchants are moving to 3P, not getting orders on the 1P's side as much. Is there any change in your business there to really kind of focus more towards third party from first party?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. No, we don't have category specifics to really share with you today on the move to one-day. I did say that generally in Q2, the unit volume was greater than revenue volume. So we did see some lower ASPs. But I think what you're seeing is just a lot more products enter the consideration set for our customers. So things that maybe they can't wait 2 days on, they can wait 1 day, and it lights up a whole separate usefulness for the Amazon site. I've noticed that personally myself, they're just -- with one-day shipments, it's here before you know it. So what categories that hits specifically, we'll have to see over time.
On your comment, I assume you meant vendors, not merchants, but -- on the move from 1P to 3P, but no, there shouldn't be -- I can't highlight anything related to shift in channel there, but I would say that we remain indifferent on whether -- we're focused on price, convenience and selection for our customers. And whether a product is a retail offering, a third-party offering is not that important to us, as long as it's in stock, as long as it's priced competitively. So as you know, our 3P selection has -- our 3P percent of units has been increasing over time. It increased again in this quarter to 54% of units. We continue to invest very heavily in our systems, both for retail vendors and also for third-party merchants, invest billions of dollars a year on behalf of them making Amazon a better place for

So as you know, our 3P selection has -- our 3P percent of units has been increasing over time. It increased again in this quarter to 54% of units. We continue to invest very heavily in our systems, both for retail vendors and also for third-party merchants, invest billions of dollars a year on behalf of them making Amazon a better place for""}","**Amazon.com Inc. Q2 2019 Earnings Call Key Insights**

**Operational Performance:**
- AWS: Showed strong growth with the run rate increasing from $24 billion to $33 billion, marking a 37% year-over-year growth and an incremental $9 billion, second only to Q4 of the previous year. Encompasses an increased pace of enterprise migrations and a robust adoption of AWS services, especially machine learning, signifying leadership in technology, ecosystem partnerships, and security.

**One-Day Shipping Impact:**
- Implementation: Amazon experienced a meaningful increase in one-day shipping, particularly in North America. Volume for one-day delivery accelerated through the quarter.
- Response: Positive customer reception with growing one-day offering influencing their buying behavior, potentially expanding the consideration set for products they need sooner.
- Costs: Exceeded the estimated cost of $800 million for Q2 due to increased transportation cost and inefficiencies related to rapidly scaling the one-day delivery operations, warehouse transitions, increased inventory, and redistribution within their network.
- Progress: The one-day shipping project is in a transitional phase and will extend over the next few quarters.

**Sales Dynamics:**
- Growth: Mention of overall acceleration in the retail business without specifying categories.
- ASP: Average Selling Price seemed to decrease in Q2 due to higher unit growth vis-√†-vis revenue growth in North America, possibly due to the mix into lower-priced items with the one-day rollout.

**Marketplace Synergy:**
- Vendor vs. Merchant Shift: No specific 1P (first-party) to 3P (third-party) shift trends were highlighted. The company aims to remain indifferent to the channel as long as competitive pricing and stock availability are met.
- 3P Growth: Third-party unit sales grew to comprise 54% of total units. Continual heavy investment in systems for both retail vendors and third-party sellers was noted.

**Guidance and Rationales:**
- Incorporation: The provided guidance factors in observed order trends and assumptions deemed appropriate as of the date of the call.
- Variables: It includes elements such as foreign exchange rates, global economic conditions, customer spending, internet and cloud services growth rates, and event impacts among others.
- Assumptions: The guidance is premised on no further business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements.
- Predictability: Noted inherent unpredictability in demand forecasting and consequent potential material differences in actual results compared to guidance.

**Financial Metrics and Trends:**
- Customer Behavior: No explicit mention of specific quantitative data on changes in customer purchasing patterns or metrics post one-day delivery implementation.

**Additional Insights:**
- Appears to place a high value on customer convenience and selection, highlighting a customer-centric approach.

Note: The extract does not contain direct quantitative financial data like EBITDA, capital expenditure, debt, free cash flow, liquidity, etc., nor detailed future projections on these metrics.

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shelly Kay Pfeiffer,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 25, 2019, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet; online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have 2. It looks like the overall retail business accelerated pretty nicely in the quarter. Maybe could you just talk about whether 24-hour shipping is driving that? And if so which specific categories of consumption are you seeing really drive that acceleration? And then sort of the opposite question on AWS which has slowed down a little bit, can you just talk about some of the puts and takes in the AWS revenue growth this quarter versus the prior Q?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Brian. Thanks for your questions. Let me start with AWS. We had a really strong quarter. We had a growth year-over-year in our run rate from $24 billion to $33 billion, so 37% growth. The $9 billion that we increased our run rate by was second only to Q4 of last year as far as our history. So as you can tell, we've been pretty transparent with our AWS revenue and income numbers, we've been breaking it out since 2015. And we're very happy with the growth in absolute dollar terms, we're seeing the pickup from customers and their usage, their increased pace of enterprise migrations, increased adoption of our services, especially our machine learning services. And continually, again, AWS is being chosen as a partner to many companies because of our leadership position both in technology, our vibrant partner ecosystem and also the stronger security that we offer.
On your question about one-day, let me update you on that because obviously that was a big topic of conversation last quarter, and you can see that it's starting to show up in our results in Q2. So we are really pleased with the customer response to our growing one-day offering. In Q2, we had a meaningful step-up in the one-day shipments, primarily in North America. And volume was -- one-day volume was accelerating throughout the quarter. The ops team did a fantastic job here, not only being able to expand one-day selection and delivery capacity, but also preparing for and handling some very high volumes on Prime Day earlier in the month.
So we're in the middle of a journey here. We expect to see a continued ramp of the one-day selection and availability for the next few quarters both in North America and international. International was up slightly in Q2, but for the most part, the improvement in delivery speeds will be, in future quarters, there. On the cost side, we talked last time about $800 million estimate of transportation cost to supply one-day -- the addition of one-day in Q2. We were a little bit higher than that number in total cost. We saw some additional transition costs in our warehouses. We saw some lower productivity as we were expanding rather quickly both local capacity and the off-season also in our delivery networks. We also saw some costs for moving -- buying more inventory and moving inventory around in our network to have it be closer to the customers. And we built that, not only that cost structure, but an accelerating cost penalty into our Q3 guidance that was released with our earnings today.
And as I said in another setting, we've seen this before. We have had large changes to our distribution and transportation network repeatedly in our history, from going from media to a vast variety of different product lines, hardlines, nonsortable as we call them, the initial 2-day Prime shipping offer that we launched many years ago, the great expansion of our network to include FBA merchants and capacity for them and more recently, the first steps to increase one-day and same-day, although on a much smaller scale. So it does create a shock to the system. We're working through that now, and we expect we'll be working through that for a number of quarters. But when the dust settles, we will regain our cost efficiency over time.
As far as you asked about specific product lines, nothing really to share there. We have seen lower ASP generally in Q2, higher unit growth versus revenue growth in North America, and we -- could be that we are mixing into some lower ASP items as we launch one-day, but we haven't drawn that total conclusion yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heath Patrick Terry,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just wondering back on the AWS side of things, can you give us a sense of sort of what you're seeing from a volume perspective? Obviously, price is always a big component of growth in this, but just trying to understand whether or not you're seeing similar trends in terms of growth rate deceleration on the volume side of things. And then to the extent that we're sort of thinking about the mix of either revenue or usage within that business, are there any products or sort of product areas, AI obviously being one that's been a major initiative for you, that you're seeing particular either outside growth or under growth relative to the overall business that you would call out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, sure. On that second point, I'd say we're seeing a lot of increased adoption in machine learning services, especially Amazon SageMaker. We've had tens of thousands of customers who are now using AWS machine learning services, and we'll continue to innovate on behalf of those customers and released more than 200 machine learning features and capabilities in 2018 alone in this area. Database is also a multibillion-dollar business propelled by Aurora. So we're seeing a lot of strength. We're seeing strong usage growth that outpaces revenue growth as usual, increased pace of enterprise migrations. So I would say that, on a percentage growth basis, again, on a dollar basis, it's growing very strongly. On a percentage growth basis, we are lapping some very strong growth in the first half of last year. We were growing about 50% in the first half of last year, and there are some particular unique customer volumes that were flowing through that, some customers have really high usage tied to their businesses. But for the most part, we continue to grow usage and our expansion of our services with all of our customers. So very happy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. Couple of questions. I guess the first question is just what happens with customer behavior when they do have one-day availability? I'm assuming units go up, but can you give us any details on what happens or a category that switches to one-day, what happens?
And the second question, we've heard from some of our checks that some of the smaller merchants are moving to 3P, not getting orders on the 1P's side as much. Is there any change in your business there to really kind of focus more towards third party from first party?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. No, we don't have category specifics to really share with you today on the move to one-day. I did say that generally in Q2, the unit volume was greater than revenue volume. So we did see some lower ASPs. But I think what you're seeing is just a lot more products enter the consideration set for our customers. So things that maybe they can't wait 2 days on, they can wait 1 day, and it lights up a whole separate usefulness for the Amazon site. I've noticed that personally myself, they're just -- with one-day shipments, it's here before you know it. So what categories that hits specifically, we'll have to see over time.
On your comment, I assume you meant vendors, not merchants, but -- on the move from 1P to 3P, but no, there shouldn't be -- I can't highlight anything related to shift in channel there, but I would say that we remain indifferent on whether -- we're focused on price, convenience and selection for our customers. And whether a product is a retail offering, a third-party offering is not that important to us, as long as it's in stock, as long as it's priced competitively. So as you know, our 3P selection has -- our 3P percent of units has been increasing over time. It increased again in this quarter to 54% of units.

One of the highlights of the call was the strong growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company reported a 37% year-over-year growth in AWS run rate, increasing from $24 billion to $33 billion. Olsavsky attributed this growth to increased customer adoption and usage of AWS's machine learning services, particularly Amazon SageMaker. He also mentioned that the database business, driven by Aurora, was a significant contributor to AWS's revenue.

The discussion also focused on the impact of Amazon's one-day shipping offering on the overall retail business. Olsavsky stated that customer response to one-day shipping has been positive, leading to a meaningful increase in one-day shipments, especially in North America. The company's operations team successfully expanded one-day selection and delivery capacity and effectively handled high volumes during Prime Day. However, the transition to one-day shipping resulted in higher costs, including additional transportation costs, warehouse transition costs, and lower productivity due to rapid expansion. Olsavsky acknowledged that these costs have affected the cost efficiency of the business but expects to regain efficiency over time.

In terms of revenue growth, the company reported lower average selling prices (ASPs) but higher unit growth in North America. Olsavsky mentioned that this could be due to a mix of lower ASP items as the company launched one-day shipping, but he emphasized that no definitive conclusions have been drawn.

Regarding the shift from first-party (1P) to third-party (3P) sellers, Olsavsky stated that Amazon remains indifferent as long as the products are in stock and competitively priced. The percentage of 3P units has been increasing over time and reached 54% in the current quarter.

Overall, Amazon provided positive guidance, expecting the continued ramp of one-day selection and availability in the coming quarters, both in North America and internationally. They considered the challenges and costs associated with the transition in their Q3 guidance.

In terms of financial disclosures, the transcript did not provide specific quantitative data related to revenue, EBITDA, capital structure, or other key performance indicators. However, the qualitative insights provided valuable context and understanding of the company's financial performance and future prospects.",gpt-3

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Darin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Head of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 27, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world event; the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
Before moving to Q&A, I would like to draw attention to a new accounting rule that we implemented in Q1. The new rule requires excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation to be presented as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. We retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to reclassify excess tax benefits from financing activities to operating activities. And as a result, you will see an increase in our free cash flow measures for prior periods.
Additionally, beginning January 1, 2017, the excess tax benefit or deficiency for stock-based compensation is recognized as a component of tax expense rather than equity. This change resulted in a decrease to our tax expense for the quarter and a corresponding increase to our net income and earnings per share. Specific changes are presented in the footnotes to the consolidated statement of cash flows and related metrics provided in our press release. Further disclosure of the impact of the adoption of this accounting change can be found in our Form 10-Q.
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Got it. Saw on the front pages of release you're really focused on India. Can you give us a progress update on how you're doing? Any thoughts on how far you're willing to take the investment levels there? And what are your thoughts on maybe when international margins can start to make progress?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Justin. Thank you. Yes, I think Jeff's comments were pretty dead on. The launch of Prime last year was a big turning point. We've increased Prime selection by 75% since launching that 9 months ago in India, also increased the fulfillment capacity for sellers by 26% this year. On the content side, we've announced 18 Indian Original TV series, and we're customizing the content. So it's a really vast selection of local and global movies and TV shows that are available to the Indian public. You'll also notice that the Fire TV Stick was -- the new version of it was launched in India with some important features there, such as the ability to search in Hindi and in English, free data usage for 3 months and also data monitoring, which is important there. So we're -- again, we continue to be encouraged by both the response from customers and sellers. As far as level of investment is concerned, it is certainly one of our important investment areas. We see a lot of potential for the country and our business there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Any thoughts on how much this is impacting your international profitability?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. I can't quantify it, but -- or break out specifically, but I will say it's a large factor as well as a couple other things in the international segment. So keep in mind that we launched Prime Video in the fourth quarter, and now we have that in over 200 countries and territories. We're spreading a lot of the Prime benefits that we've seen in North America to other countries. We just opened up AmazonFresh in Tokyo last weekend, but also Prime Now. You saw other things like our business -- B2B business just opened up in the U.K. We have Amazon devices. So there's a lot of moving parts here. The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon fulfilled network or the units we shipped are growing at much faster clip than our paid unit growth. Last year, we said that was a 40% -- nearly 40% growth worldwide, so we're making the investments in warehouses, fulfillment capacity and delivery capacity to handle that. So there's a lot going on in international. We are very encouraged with the growth of the Prime program, and we're hopeful for the Prime Video that we launched in the fall.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark S. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. 2 questions. The North American operating margins seem to come down like 70 bps year-over-year, and I know it's not a big focus of you, the margins. I get that, but it's sort of a change. You've had margins be flat or up year-over-year for quite some time and now they dip down. Just could you explain that? And then secondly, on these -- on the Echo devices, the Echo family, Alexa devices that are coming out, could you comment at all about what kind of impact you're seeing in terms of increased wallet or per share within household? Are you seeing that have an impact in terms of Amazon customers more likely to spend more once they have these devices in particular categories like groceries or household products, Pantry, products that they're more likely to spend because they have these devices in their houses, in their kitchens, in their living rooms?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Mark. Let me start with the Echo question first. So yes, we're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products. Not only the Echo products, but the ability to use tablets -- our tablets now as Echo devices since we've spread the Alexa technology to many of those devices. And we're also happy with the success we've had with developers. There's over now over 12,000 Alexa skills. So we think that's all foundational. The monetization, as you might call it, is -- the theme of your questions, that's not our primary issue right now. It's about building great products and delighting customers. We think as engagement -- as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole. So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa device or whether they're going to their phone or going to their computer, it all has the same effect for us. So very, very pleased with the initial progress. We see a lot of momentum there, and we continue to invest. And that's one of the answers to your second question on North America operating margin. So if I step back, let me just talk generally about investment. So right now we're just seeing a lot of great opportunities before us, and we're continuing to ramp up the investments in pursuit of those opportunities. And the big picture is, again, as we've said, customers -- we want the things that customers love, can grow to be large, will have strong financial returns and they're durable and can last for decades. So in that category and some of the things that we are investing the most in are, as you say, the Echo and Alexa devices. We're doubling down on that investment, video content and marketing, not only in the U.S. but globally with the launch of our Prime Video in the fall. So we're building global scale in that business in both content and marketing. As I said earlier, we're expanding Prime benefits in the U.S. and also globally, things like Prime Music, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all expanding globally. And we've launched Prime in India, China and Mexico. I know I'm drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same theme. We also have this trend going on in our fulfillment networks where strong FBA growth and high growth in Amazon fulfilled units is resulting in a large increase in fulfillment capacity. We're also investing in new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning. You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we've developed in Seattle; drones. We use those technologies a lot in our internal businesses, and we're also developing services for AWS customers. So -- and that's -- of course, another area as AWS continues to grow and add services and features and doing so at an accelerating rate. So there's a long list and I can keep going, but I think the general theme is we're -- there's a lot of investment in front of us that we're optimistic about and we continue to ramp those investments. In North America, that manifests itself mostly in the device area, the content area and also the expansion of the fulfillment networks.

5. Technological Advances: Investments in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, Amazon Go, drones, and services for AWS customers were mentioned, revealing the company's dedication to innovation. The financial implications of these investments were not detailed in the excerpt.

Operational Insights:
- Seasonality and other specific insights related to industry dynamics, cost savings, macroeconomic environment, or capital expenditure were not addressed.
- Regarding capital structure, future transactions, debt, and liquidity, no quantitative data was provided.
- The implementation of a new accounting rule regarding excess tax benefits for stock-based compensation was mentioned, indicating an increase in free cash flows for prior periods and a decrease in tax expense for the quarter, boosting net income and EPS. However, specific figures were not disclosed.
- There was no explicit forward guidance or rationale provided in the excerpt.
- Operating margins in North America decreased by 70 basis points year-over-year, attributed to investments in devices, content, and fulfillment networks, but precise figures were not quoted.

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.

Darin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Head of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 27, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world event; the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
Before moving to Q&A, I would like to draw attention to a new accounting rule that we implemented in Q1. The new rule requires excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation to be presented as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. We retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to reclassify excess tax benefits from financing activities to operating activities. And as a result, you will see an increase in our free cash flow measures for prior periods.
Additionally, beginning January 1, 2017, the excess tax benefit or deficiency for stock-based compensation is recognized as a component of tax expense rather than equity. This change resulted in a decrease to our tax expense for the quarter and a corresponding increase to our net income and earnings per share. Specific changes are presented in the footnotes to the consolidated statement of cash flows and related metrics provided in our press release. Further disclosure of the impact of the adoption of this accounting change can be found in our Form 10-Q.
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Got it. Saw on the front pages of release you're really focused on India. Can you give us a progress update on how you're doing? Any thoughts on how far you're willing to take the investment levels there? And what are your thoughts on maybe when international margins can start to make progress?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Justin. Thank you. Yes, I think Jeff's comments were pretty dead on. The launch of Prime last year was a big turning point. We've increased Prime selection by 75% since launching that 9 months ago in India, also increased the fulfillment capacity for sellers by 26% this year. On the content side, we've announced 18 Indian Original TV series, and we're customizing the content. So it's a really vast selection of local and global movies and TV shows that are available to the Indian public. You'll also notice that the Fire TV Stick was -- the new version of it was launched in India with some important features there, such as the ability to search in Hindi and in English, free data usage for 3 months and also data monitoring, which is important there. So we're -- again, we continue to be encouraged by both the response from customers and sellers. As far as level of investment is concerned, it is certainly one of our important investment areas. We see a lot of potential for the country and our business there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Any thoughts on how much this is impacting your international profitability?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. I can't quantify it, but -- or break out specifically, but I will say it's a large factor as well as a couple other things in the international segment. So keep in mind that we launched Prime Video in the fourth quarter, and now we have that in over 200 countries and territories. We're spreading a lot of the Prime benefits that we've seen in North America to other countries. We just opened up AmazonFresh in Tokyo last weekend, but also Prime Now. You saw other things like our business -- B2B business just opened up in the U.K. We have Amazon devices. So there's a lot of moving parts here. The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon fulfilled network or the units we shipped are growing at much faster clip than our paid unit growth. Last year, we said that was a 40% -- nearly 40% growth worldwide, so we're making the investments in warehouses, fulfillment capacity and delivery capacity to handle that. So there's a lot going on in international. We are very encouraged with the growth of the Prime program, and we're hopeful for the Prime Video that we launched in the fall.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark S. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. 2 questions. The North American operating margins seem to come down like 70 bps year-over-year, and I know it's not a big focus of you, the margins. I get that, but it's sort of a change. You've had margins be flat or up year-over-year for quite some time and now they dip down. Just could you explain that? And then secondly, on these -- on the Echo devices, the Echo family, Alexa devices that are coming out, could you comment at all about what kind of impact you're seeing in terms of increased wallet or per share within household? Are you seeing that have an impact in terms of Amazon customers more likely to spend more once they have these devices in particular categories like groceries or household products, Pantry, products that they're more likely to spend because they have these devices in their houses, in their kitchens, in their living rooms?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Mark. Let me start with the Echo question first. So yes, we're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products. Not only the Echo products, but the ability to use tablets -- our tablets now as Echo devices since we've spread the Alexa technology to many of those devices. And we're also happy with the success we've had with developers. There's over now over 12,000 Alexa skills. So we think that's all foundational. The monetization, as you might call it, is -- the theme of your questions, that's not our primary issue right now. It's about building great products and delighting customers. We think as engagement -- as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole. So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa device or whether they're going to their phone or going to their computer, it all has the same effect for us. So very, very pleased with the initial progress. We see a lot of momentum there, and we continue to invest. And that's one of the answers to your second question on North America operating margin. So if I step back, let me just talk generally about investment. So right now we're just seeing a lot of great opportunities before us, and we're continuing to ramp up the investments in pursuit of those opportunities. And the big picture is, again, as we've said, customers -- we want the things that customers love, can grow to be large, will have strong financial returns and they're durable and can last for decades. So in that category and some of the things that we are investing the most in are, as you say, the Echo and Alexa devices. We're doubling down on that investment, video content and marketing, not only in the U.S. but globally with the launch of our Prime Video in the fall. So we're building global scale in that business in both content and marketing. As I said earlier, we're expanding Prime benefits in the U.S. and also globally, things like Prime Music, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all expanding globally. And we've launched Prime in India, China and Mexico. I know I'm drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same theme. We also have this trend going on in our fulfillment networks where strong FBA growth and high growth in Amazon fulfilled units is resulting in a large increase in fulfillment capacity. We're also investing in new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning. You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we've developed in Seattle; drones. We use those technologies a lot in our internal businesses, and we're also developing services for AWS customers. So -- and that's -- of course, another area as AWS continues to grow and add services and features and doing so at an accelerating rate. So there's a long list and I can keep going, but I think the general theme is we're -- there's a lot of investment in front of us that we're optimistic about and we continue to ramp those investments. In North America, that manifests itself mostly in the device area, the content area and also the expansion of the fulfillment networks.

In terms of revenue drivers, Olsavsky highlighted the launch of Prime in India, which has seen a significant increase in selection and fulfillment capacity. He also mentioned the success of Prime Video, which is now available in over 200 countries and territories. These international expansions have contributed to the growth of the Prime program and the company's overall business.

When asked about the impact of these investments on international profitability, Olsavsky acknowledged that it is a significant factor, along with other initiatives such as the launch of AmazonFresh in Tokyo and Prime Now in other countries. The company is focused on building warehouses, fulfillment capacity, and delivery capacity to accommodate the growth in units shipped. Olsavsky did not provide specific figures for the impact on profitability, but he emphasized the positive response from customers and sellers in these markets.

Olsavsky also addressed the decrease in North American operating margins, stating that it was primarily due to the increased investment in areas such as Echo and Alexa devices, video content and marketing, and the expansion of Prime benefits. Amazon is doubling down on these investments to build great products and delight customers. The company sees a lot of potential in these areas and is optimistic about their long-term impact.

Overall, the transcript suggests that Amazon is focused on international expansion and investing in key areas such as Prime, devices, content, and fulfillment networks. The company is optimistic about the growth opportunities and is willing to make significant investments to capitalize on them. The impact on profitability is acknowledged but not quantified, as the focus is on long-term growth and customer engagement.

It's worth noting that the transcript does not provide specific quantitative data or financial performance metrics. Instead, it primarily focuses on qualitative aspects of the company's performance and strategic initiatives.",gpt-3

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 31, 2019, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisition, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I guess I'll ask about units, 14% in the quarter. Just how do you feel about the overall unit growth here given that growth was higher last year in the 20s? And do you think there's some investments you can make in other areas to kind of reaccelerate that going forward? And then, secondly, just if you could remind us or help us understand the Prime accounting change impact on subscription revenues in Q4?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Justin, this is Dave. On the second question, on the subscription service, we'd said on the last call, you probably remember, related to the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update and revenue recognition policies that was impacting our results in a number of areas in 2018, we'd said we'd anticipated about $300 million lower sort of headwind to subscription services revenue due to the accounting change. So that's where we came out for the quarter. So you'll see that we reported subscription services revenue increased 26%, when you exclude FX. So the $300 million is certainly part of that decelerate, a sequential deceleration in the growth rate in that line item.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, and on unit deceleration, I think the unit numbers more and more require some interpretation because it doesn't include the fast -- some of our fastest growing areas, things like, as Dave mentioned, subscription services, AWS, advertising, Whole Foods units are not in that number. So we don't focus as much on the number. I would direct you more to the supplemental revenue guidance that breaks out the component parts. But in general, we feel good about the growth in the quarter. We think it was a -- Q4, in particular, was a great quarter for customers. The retail, a lot of strength in the retail part of the businesses. The teams here had done a great job planning, preparing and then executing on the quarter. AWS maintained a very strong growth rate and continue to deliver for customers. We had a great re:Invent conference in the quarter. So we feel good about the growth in the quarter and also the total revenue and income.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Do you want to just comment a little bit on the international revenue outlook and any commentary on India and whether you think there's a material impact on your business? Secondly, could you talk about advertising revenue, just qualitatively or quantitatively, how that's doing? And third, if I could, you spent a lot on marketing in the quarter. It's a real step up. Do you want to just talk about the ROI that you think you're getting on that marketing spend?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Mark. The first question's on India. Let me start with that. So we have incorporated into our guidance estimate, the best estimate we have for Q1 in India. However, there's much uncertainty as to what the impact of the government role changes is going to have on the e-commerce sector there. We remain committed to complying with all laws and regulations, and we will, but we're evaluating the situation. Our main issue and our main concern is trying to minimize the impact to our customers and sellers in India. We've built our business around price selection and convenience. We don't think the changes help in those dimensions for both the customers in India and also the sellers. Dave, why don't you talk about the advertising growth?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I think, I mean, we're continuing to -- there's a lot of focus on serving that customer set. One of the things we're trying to do is continually evolve our tools and the products to help that customer set, agencies, advertisers, make sure they've got a variety of ways to meet their goals. Some of the things we've done more recently over the last few months or so was expanded sponsor, brands placements, rolled out new campaign reports, so improve campaign manager features. So a number of -- there's a number of things beyond that, but features out there that are just going to, I think, make it easier for companies to grow with ad tools and the ad services that we offer. And we're continually excited about the opportunity there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And then, on your question on marketing, yes, the marketing percent of revenue was up 110 basis points year-over-year. The -- this category also includes AWS sales and marketing. Keep that in mind because that's where a lot of our headcount investment is going. Headcount only grew 14% year-over-year, but the areas that we're growing in that mix were things like technology teams, device areas, AWS, especially sales and marketing. So variable marketing was pretty consistent with prior periods, and we feel good about our return on investment on the marketing, the variable marketing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I just wanted to follow up on India. Just bigger picture, Brian, did the new policies change your view at all the attractiveness or the potential of operating in India? And how do you think about your investment strategy there in the near term? And then, also, just hoping you could talk about some of the impact in the U.S. and U.K. from free shipping during the fourth quarter holidays?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, really, we're still evaluating the situation in India. We feel very good about the long-term prospects in India and doing a good job for both Indian customers and Indian sellers. The new regulations need to be interpreted, need to be -- need to make sure they don't have unintended consequences. And again, I don't think it's necessarily consistent with better price, better selection, better convenience for the Indian customer. So it's all we can say on that topic right now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, and I think, Doug, your second point was just around shipping, some of the shipping offers in the holiday. We did lower the free shipping threshold at the end of the fourth quarter, so customers took advantage of that. That was a great offer for them in the holidays. Brian talked a little about it before, but pleased with the holiday season, both from sort of a first-party side, but also sellers continue to do well. That's part of the holiday offering. We sold a number of record-breaking number of Alexa devices as well. And I think, just in that shipping vein, really pleased with the continued engagement from Prime members. We had the most-ever number of Prime members sign up this quarter than any quarter we've had. So really pleased with that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Alan May,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          When I try to back out the impact of factors like Whole Foods, the advertising accounting change and other factors, what I see is stable and pretty healthy revenue growth in the retail segment but a slowdown

1. **Unit Growth Deceleration**: Amazon saw a deceleration in unit growth to 14% in Q4 compared to growth rates in the 20s the previous year. While specific numbers weren't given, this deceleration is notable. It is suggested that this deceleration may not fully encapsulate the health of the business as some of the fastest-growing areas such as AWS, advertising, and Whole Foods sales are not included in the unit numbers. 

2. **Impact of Accounting Changes on Subscription Services**: The adoption of new revenue recognition standards created an anticipated $300 million headwind to subscription services revenue for Q4 2018. Despite this, subscription services revenue grew 26% year-over-year when excluding the impact of foreign exchange.

3. **Advertising and AWS Marketing**: Specific quantitative details on the performance of advertising revenue were not provided, although the company continued to focus on improving tools and features for advertisers. AWS marketing is highlighted as an area where significant headcount investments are being made, suggesting considerable marketing efforts in that segment.

4. **Marketing Expenses**: The marketing expenditure increased by 110 basis points year-over-year, attributed in part to AWS sales and marketing expenses. While specific ROI metrics were not mentioned, the CFO said they feel good about the return on their variable marketing investment.

5. **Prime Membership**: During Q4, Amazon had the highest ever number of Prime sign-ups for any quarter, indicating strong growth in membership.

**Guidance and Rationale:**

1. **Impact of India‚Äôs Regulation Changes**: Amazon's guidance incorporates the potential impact of India's e-commerce regulation changes, though there is considerable uncertainty regarding these effects. Commitment to compliance with Indian law is reiterated, alongside concerns about potentially negative consequences for customer pricing, selection, and convenience. A qualitative commitment to the Indian market is mentioned, but without specific quantification or projected figures.

2. **Shipping Offers**: The reduction in the free shipping threshold during Q4 was a driver of customer interest, although the exact impact on revenue or cost isn't quantified. The overall positive reception of this and the high engagement from Prime members during the holiday season are noted.

**Qualitative Performance Color:**

1. **Customer and Seller Impact in India**: The company is concerned about minimizing the impact of regulatory changes in India on its customers and sellers, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the quality of service in terms of price, selection, and convenience.

2. **Investment Strategy**: Although there was no change communicated in the investment strategy for India, the company expressed a need to interpret and understand the full impact of regulatory changes. There was no explicit mention of altering investment levels or redirecting resources as a result of the new policies.

3. **Holiday Season and Prime Engagement**: The holiday season was described as successful, with a record-breaking number of Alexa devices sold, and the most-ever Prime sign-ups, suggesting strong brand appeal and customer engagement.

**Operational and Strategic Themes:**

- There is a shift in focus from unit numbers to revenue guidance to understand the company's growth better, due to the diverse components of their business.
- Continued investments in marketing, especially AWS sales and marketing, suggesting a focus on growth in cloud services.
- Customer-centric approach remains a priority, with emphasis on maintaining service quality amidst regulatory challenges in India.

**Contextual Caveats or Conditions:**

- Regulatory environment in India is subject to interpretation and could materially affect Amazon's operations there. The company includes this in their guidance but acknowledges inherent unpredictability.
- The growth in subscription services has been partly impacted by accounting changes, which is factored into their reported financials.
- Marketing spend ROI is stated to be satisfactory without detailing specific figures or comparing against previous periods.
- No specific quantitative details are provided on the advertising revenue, although qualitative comments suggest continued expansion and innovation in this area.

**Consolidated Themes:**

- Revenue diversification with a decreased focus on pure unit growth due to the varying nature of growth drivers such as AWS, advertising, and subscription services.
- Compliance and strategic navigation of regulatory environments, particularly in India, with an emphasis on minimizing customer and seller impact.
- Investment in customer acquisition and retention, underscored by robust Prime membership growth and aggressive marketing strategies.
- Continued confidence in operational execution, as evidenced by customer satisfaction during the holiday season and successful product sales.

**Omitted Aspects:**

- Specific numbers regarding the growth rate of AWS or advertising revenue have been withheld.
- Precise figures measuring the impact of reduced shipping thresholds on revenue or margins during Q4 are not provided.
- The transcript does not offer detailed forward guidance projections or precise expected figures for the subsequent quarters or the fiscal year.
- In-depth analysis of cost structures, EBITDA, capital expenditure, debt, and free cash flow are not included in the extracted part of the earnings call transcript.",gpt-4

          Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 31, 2019, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisition, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I guess I'll ask about units, 14% in the quarter. Just how do you feel about the overall unit growth here given that growth was higher last year in the 20s? And do you think there's some investments you can make in other areas to kind of reaccelerate that going forward? And then, secondly, just if you could remind us or help us understand the Prime accounting change impact on subscription revenues in Q4?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Justin, this is Dave. On the second question, on the subscription service, we'd said on the last call, you probably remember, related to the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update and revenue recognition policies that was impacting our results in a number of areas in 2018, we'd said we'd anticipated about $300 million lower sort of headwind to subscription services revenue due to the accounting change. So that's where we came out for the quarter. So you'll see that we reported subscription services revenue increased 26%, when you exclude FX. So the $300 million is certainly part of that decelerate, a sequential deceleration in the growth rate in that line item.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, and on unit deceleration, I think the unit numbers more and more require some interpretation because it doesn't include the fast -- some of our fastest growing areas, things like, as Dave mentioned, subscription services, AWS, advertising, Whole Foods units are not in that number. So we don't focus as much on the number. I would direct you more to the supplemental revenue guidance that breaks out the component parts. But in general, we feel good about the growth in the quarter. We think it was a -- Q4, in particular, was a great quarter for customers. The retail, a lot of strength in the retail part of the businesses. The teams here had done a great job planning, preparing and then executing on the quarter. AWS maintained a very strong growth rate and continue to deliver for customers. We had a great re:Invent conference in the quarter. So we feel good about the growth in the quarter and also the total revenue and income.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Do you want to just comment a little bit on the international revenue outlook and any commentary on India and whether you think there's a material impact on your business? Secondly, could you talk about advertising revenue, just qualitatively or quantitatively, how that's doing? And third, if I could, you spent a lot on marketing in the quarter. It's a real step up. Do you want to just talk about the ROI that you think you're getting on that marketing spend?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Mark. The first question's on India. Let me start with that. So we have incorporated into our guidance estimate, the best estimate we have for Q1 in India. However, there's much uncertainty as to what the impact of the government role changes is going to have on the e-commerce sector there. We remain committed to complying with all laws and regulations, and we will, but we're evaluating the situation. Our main issue and our main concern is trying to minimize the impact to our customers and sellers in India. We've built our business around price selection and convenience. We don't think the changes help in those dimensions for both the customers in India and also the sellers. Dave, why don't you talk about the advertising growth?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I think, I mean, we're continuing to -- there's a lot of focus on serving that customer set. One of the things we're trying to do is continually evolve our tools and the products to help that customer set, agencies, advertisers, make sure they've got a variety of ways to meet their goals. Some of the things we've done more recently over the last few months or so was expanded sponsor, brands placements, rolled out new campaign reports, so improve campaign manager features. So a number of -- there's a number of things beyond that, but features out there that are just going to, I think, make it easier for companies to grow with ad tools and the ad services that we offer. And we're continually excited about the opportunity there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And then, on your question on marketing, yes, the marketing percent of revenue was up 110 basis points year-over-year. The -- this category also includes AWS sales and marketing. Keep that in mind because that's where a lot of our headcount investment is going. Headcount only grew 14% year-over-year, but the areas that we're growing in that mix were things like technology teams, device areas, AWS, especially sales and marketing. So variable marketing was pretty consistent with prior periods, and we feel good about our return on investment on the marketing, the variable marketing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I just wanted to follow up on India. Just bigger picture, Brian, did the new policies change your view at all the attractiveness or the potential of operating in India? And how do you think about your investment strategy there in the near term? And then, also, just hoping you could talk about some of the impact in the U.S. and U.K. from free shipping during the fourth quarter holidays?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, really, we're still evaluating the situation in India. We feel very good about the long-term prospects in India and doing a good job for both Indian customers and Indian sellers. The new regulations need to be interpreted, need to be -- need to make sure they don't have unintended consequences. And again, I don't think it's necessarily consistent with better price, better selection, better convenience for the Indian customer. So it's all we can say on that topic right now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, and I think, Doug, your second point was just around shipping, some of the shipping offers in the holiday. We did lower the free shipping threshold at the end of the fourth quarter, so customers took advantage of that. That was a great offer for them in the holidays. Brian talked a little about it before, but pleased with the holiday season, both from sort of a first-party side, but also sellers continue to do well. That's part of the holiday offering. We sold a number of record-breaking number of Alexa devices as well. And I think, just in that shipping vein, really pleased with the continued engagement from Prime members. We had the most-ever number of Prime members sign up this quarter than any quarter we've had. So really pleased with that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Alan May,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          When I try to back out the impact of factors like Whole Foods, the advertising accounting change and other factors, what I see is stable and pretty healthy revenue growth in the retail segment but a slowdown

1. Revenue growth: The transcript highlights stable and healthy revenue growth in Amazon's retail segment. However, there was a slowdown in the overall growth rate compared to the previous year, which was attributed to factors such as changes in accounting standards for subscription services.

2. Unit growth: There was a deceleration in unit growth, but it should be noted that this measure does not include some of Amazon's fastest-growing areas such as subscription services, AWS, advertising, and Whole Foods units. The company emphasized the importance of focusing on the supplemental revenue guidance that breaks down the different components.

3. International revenue outlook: The company expressed uncertainty regarding the impact of government rule changes in India on the e-commerce sector. Amazon remains committed to complying with laws and regulations but is evaluating the situation to minimize the impact on customers and sellers. The company stated that the changes in regulations may not be consistent with Amazon's core principles of better price, selection, and convenience.

4. Advertising revenue: Amazon continues to focus on serving its customer set by evolving its advertising tools and products. The company has rolled out new features and placements to make it easier for advertisers and agencies to achieve their goals. Amazon remains excited about the advertising opportunity.

5. Marketing spend: Amazon's marketing spend increased year-over-year, driven by investments in areas such as technology teams, device areas, and AWS sales and marketing. The company expressed confidence in the return on investment for its marketing spend.

6. Seasonal impact: Amazon lowered the free shipping threshold during the fourth quarter, which resulted in increased customer engagement and a record-breaking number of Prime member sign-ups. The holiday season saw strong performance in both the first-party and third-party seller segments.

7. India operations: The company continues to view India as having long-term prospects, but the new government regulations create uncertainty. Amazon is closely monitoring the situation to ensure compliance and minimize the negative impact on customers and sellers.

Overall, Amazon's revenue growth remained strong, but there were certain factors affecting growth rates, such as changes in accounting standards and regulatory challenges in India. The company remains focused on serving customers, evolving its advertising tools, and making strategic investments.",gpt-3

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.

Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I wanted to ask if you had any update on the state of the advertising business? Sort of the state of conversations with advertisers, what product uptake you're seeing out in the marketplace? And sort of how that's looking now as we move out of '17 and into 2018, broadly, for the platform?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Sure, Eric. I would say, advertising continues to be a bright spot, both from a product standpoint, and also, financially. It was -- continued to be a strong contributor to profitability in Q1. It's now a multibillion-dollar program. You can see the -- in our supplemental revenue disclosure, it's in other revenue, and it's the majority of the other revenue in that line item. So we -- our philosophy there, again, is we're continuing to focus on finding valuable ways to make our advertising opportunities better for customers, showing them new products that they may not have seen otherwise, and also for emerging and established brands, helping them to reach customers. I think the advertisers, generally, are all shapes and sizes, and their common theme is they want to reach our customers, generally, to drive brand awareness, discovery, and eventually, purchase. Before I go on to the second question, I want to make a comment about the Prime program. Prime program continues to drive great strength in our top line, as you've seen over the last few years, actually. We continue to increase the value of Prime, including speed selection and digital entertainment options. We've been expanding FREE Same-Day Shipping and 1-day options. And our 2-day shipping, it's now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014. And we continue to add digital benefits, like Prime Video. The value of Prime to customers has never been greater. And the cost is also high. As we pointed out especially with shipping options and digital benefits, we continue to see rises in costs. So effective May 11, we're going to increase the price of our U.S. annual plan from $99 to $119, for new members. The new price will apply to renewals starting on June 16. Prime provides a unique combination of benefits, and we continue to invest in making this Prime program even more valuable for our members. As a reminder, we haven't increased the U.S. annual price Prime since our single increase, which was in March of 2014.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. And Eric, sorry to just go back to your initial question too, just to hop back on that, I just want to remind folks that we've mentioned this last quarter on the call, but on January 1, we adopted an accounting standard update that amended our revenue recognition policies. So the net impact to revenue in the first quarter was not material, but I do want to highlight a few areas. As part of the adoption beginning in Q1, certain advertising services are classified as revenue, rather than a reduction of costs to sales. So the impact of this change was an increase of $560 million to other revenue in Q1, which is the other revenue was, of course, part of our supplemental sales disclosure. So you'll see that other revenue, in total, increased 132% ex FX year-over-year to about $2 billion in the first quarter, again, $560 million is included in there, and the majority of that is -- would be included in the North America segment. As you look at the other supplemental line items, just a few items of note. The line item online stores revenue increased about 13%, ex FX. Beginning in the first quarter, sales of apps, in-app content, certain digital media content, are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third-party seller services revenue, rather than net online stores revenue. So in the first quarter, online stores revenue would have been higher, but for this new standard. And then, the line item, subscription services revenue, that increased about 56% ex FX year-over-year. Prime members are -- Prime memberships are included in that line. Again, beginning in the first quarter, we now recognize annual Prime membership revenue straight line over the 12-month period. Prior to 2018, we recognize this revenue over the 12-month period with more revenue allocated to the fourth quarter each year. So in Q1 of this year's subscription services revenue would have been lower, but for this new standard.

          Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So the first one, on Prime, let me ask you this. As you think about your U.S. Prime penetration, there's some data that shows you're doing a very good job at capturing a lot of the middle to higher income households and now you're raising price. Talk about the tension point you need to solve to sort of reach some of the lower income households and even households that are not yet Prime. What are the main reasons why people in the U.S. are not signing on for Prime at this point? And the second one, on early learnings from the integration of Prime Now and Whole Foods, recognizing it's only in a few cities. What can you share about what you're seeing about purchase behavior, early learnings? And what are the main signposts you're watching as you determine how quickly to roll that out to more cities in the U.S., and hopefully, New York soon?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. On your first question about Prime penetration, without getting into any statistics on penetration and by country, I would say we do have other options for, if you'll notice, there's the monthly option, obviously provides more flexibility for people who want to try out Prime before committing to the annual plan. There's discounted student plans. There's also discounts for other groups. So we do feel it's still the best deal in retail, and we just work to make it better and better each day. The second thing you mentioned is a good example. So the ability in 10 cities to get Prime Now deliveries of Whole Foods groceries is an added benefit for people in that market using Prime -- those markets using Prime Now. So as far as the Whole Foods, specifically on the question of what'll -- what we'll look at as far as expanding that grocery delivery, we're going to use the 10 cities as a test and see how customers respond, just like we always do, and make sure that our deliveries are great for those people, and then we'll announce expansion plans once we digest that, the feedback we get from customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heath Patrick Terry,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I was just wondering if you could give us a sense. The accelerating growth that we saw in the U.S. business in Q1, how much of that or how would you sort of segment that in terms of specific categories? Are there any specific categories that you would call out in terms of driving that? And then, as we look at the like acceleration in the AWS business, any sense that you can give us in terms of what volumes or customer you specifically call out sort of customer additions in some of your comments, what customer additions have looked like in terms of driving that business, particularly against sort of the comp against last year's price cuts?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. So first, with the -- you've mentioned North America revenue growth, and you can calculate that with and without the impact of Whole Foods, I'm sure, but the general drivers continues to be Prime and the Prime Flywheel, so we see strong customer demand, not only for the benefits that we associate with Prime, we're seeing better engagement with Prime Benefits, especially Digital and Benefits, and that is always good news for eventual sales of other things. We're also selling more subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited, multiple -- Kindle Unlimited, there's a number of services. So there's different revenue streams that we see. So not much more I can add by product line to North America. Now I talk about AWS revenue, again, we're -- we are accelerating. We've accelerated for the last 2 quarters. The FX-neutral growth was 48% in Q1, up from 44% on the same basis in Q4 and 42% in Q3. And now nearly a $22 billion run rate. So what we're seeing is just

Sort of the state of conversations with advertisers, what product uptake you're seeing out in the marketplace? And sort of how that's looking now as we move out of '17 and into 2018, broadly, for the platform?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Yes. Sure, Eric. I would say, advertising continues to be a bright spot, both from a product standpoint, and also, financially. It was -- continued to be a strong contributor to profitability in Q1. It's now a multibillion-dollar program. You can see the -- in our supplemental revenue disclosure, it's in other revenue, and it's the majority of the other revenue in that line item. So we -- our philosophy there, again, is we're continuing to focus on finding valuable ways to make our advertising opportunities better for customers, showing them new products that they may not have seen otherwise, and also for emerging and established brands, helping them to reach customers. I think the advertisers, generally, are all shapes and sizes, and their common theme is they want to reach our customers, generally, to drive brand awareness, discovery, and eventually, purchase. Before I go on to the second question, I want to make a comment about the Prime program. Prime program continues to drive great strength in our top line, as you've seen over the last few years, actually. We continue to increase the value of Prime, including speed selection and digital entertainment options. We've been expanding FREE Same-Day Shipping and 1-day options. And our 2-day shipping, it's now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014. And we continue to add digital benefits, like Prime Video. The value of Prime to customers has never been greater. And the cost is also high. As we pointed out especially with shipping options and digital benefits, we continue to see rises in costs. So effective May 11, we're going to increase the price of our U.S. annual plan from $99 to $119, for new members. The new price will apply to renewals starting on June 16. Prime provides a unique combination of benefits, and we continue to invest in making this Prime program even more valuable for our members. As a reminder, we haven't increased the U.S. annual price Prime since our single increase, which was in March of 2014.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Yes.

The FX-neutral growth was 48% in Q1, up from 44% on the same basis in Q4 and 42% in Q3. And now nearly a $22 billion run rate. So what we're seeing is just ""}","**Advertising Business and Revenue Growth:**
- Amazon's advertising business continues to experience strong growth and is highlighted as a significant driver of profitability in Q1 2018. It is now a multibillion-dollar program with the majority of the ""other revenue"" now stemming from advertising.
- ""Other revenue"" increased by 132% year-over-year to approximately $2 billion in Q1, with $560 million attributed to this growth due to a new accounting standard, which now classifies certain advertising services as revenue rather than a reduction of cost of sales. 
- The impact of the new accounting standard was not considered materially impactful on Amazon.com Inc.'s overall revenue.

**Prime Membership and Price Change:**
- Prime membership, a critical engine for top-line growth, is seeing enhancements in its value proposition through expanded fast shipping and digital entertainment options.
- Over 100 million items are now eligible for 2-day shipping, jumping significantly from 20 million in 2014.
- On May 11, 2018, the cost of the U.S. annual Prime will increase from $99 to $119 for new members, with renewals reflecting the new price starting June 16. This change is due to rising costs, mainly associated with shipping and digital benefits.

**Subscriptions and Revenue Recognition:**
- Subscription services revenue, which includes Prime memberships, increased by approximately 56% year-over-year excluding foreign exchange impacts.
- A change in revenue recognition now spreads annual Prime membership revenue evenly over a 12-month period. Previously, more revenue was allocated to Q4.

**AWS and Accelerating Growth:**
- AWS's growth rate is accelerating, marking a jump in revenue growth to 48% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange impacts in Q1, from 44% in Q4 and 42% in Q3 of the previous year. It's close to a $22 billion run rate.

**Category-Level Revenue Drivers:**
- The North American segment saw accelerated growth, partially attributable to Whole Foods' inclusion since its acquisition.
- The Prime Flywheel remains a significant driver, with increased engagement and subscriptions across diverse services, including Amazon Music Unlimited and Kindle Unlimited, contributing to revenue streams.

**Customer Engagement and Market Expansion:**
- The strong demand tied to Prime and its associated benefits is occurring alongside increased customer engagement with digital offerings.
- Amazon is testing grocery delivery from Whole Foods in 10 cities, watching customer responses before planning wider expansion.

**Guidance Rationale:**
- The guidance issued includes observed order trends and assumptions that Amazon management deems appropriate at the time of the call.
- However, factors such as fluctuating foreign exchange rates, global economic conditions, changing customer spending patterns, and broader world events create inherent unpredictability that could materially impact actual results.
- Assumptions underpinning the guidance also presume no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements going forward.

**Financial Policies and Reporting Changes:**
- The adoption of a new accounting standard has led to a change in the classification of certain revenue streams and recognition practices.
- App and digital content sales are now presented on a net basis within third-party seller services revenue rather than online stores revenue.
- It‚Äôs noted that had these accounting changes not been in effect, online stores revenue in Q1 2018 would have been reported as higher, and subscription services revenue would have been lower.",gpt-4

Questions and Answers

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I wanted to ask if you had any update on the state of the advertising business? Sort of the state of conversations with advertisers, what product uptake you're seeing out in the marketplace? And sort of how that's looking now as we move out of '17 and into 2018, broadly, for the platform?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Sure, Eric. I would say, advertising continues to be a bright spot, both from a product standpoint, and also, financially. It was -- continued to be a strong contributor to profitability in Q1. It's now a multibillion-dollar program.

Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. And Eric, sorry to just go back to your initial question too, just to hop back on that, I just want to remind folks that we've mentioned this last quarter on the call, but on January 1, we adopted an accounting standard update that amended our revenue recognition policies. So the net impact to revenue in the first quarter was not material, but I do want to highlight a few areas.

Beginning in the first quarter, sales of apps, in-app content, certain digital media content, are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third-party seller services revenue, rather than net online stores revenue. So in the first quarter, online stores revenue would have been higher, but for this new standard. And then, the line item, subscription services revenue, that increased about 56% ex FX year-over-year. Prime members are -- Prime memberships are included in that line. Again, beginning in the first quarter, we now recognize annual Prime membership revenue straight line over the 12-month period. Prior to 2018, we recognize this revenue over the 12-month period with more revenue allocated to the fourth quarter each year. So in Q1 of this year's subscription services revenue would have been lower, but for this new standard.

          Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So the first one, on Prime, let me ask you this. As you think about your U.S. Prime penetration, there's some data that shows you're doing a very good job at capturing a lot of the middle to higher income households and now you're raising price. Talk about the tension point you need to solve to sort of reach some of the lower income households and even households that are not yet Prime. What are the main reasons why people in the U.S. are not signing on for Prime at this point? And the second one, on early learnings from the integration of Prime Now and Whole Foods, recognizing it's only in a few cities. What can you share about what you're seeing about purchase behavior, early learnings? And what are the main signposts you're watching as you determine how quickly to roll that out to more cities in the U.S., and hopefully, New York soon?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. On your first question about Prime penetration, without getting into any statistics on penetration and by country, I would say we do have other options for, if you'll notice, there's the monthly option, obviously provides more flexibility for people who want to try out Prime before committing to the annual plan. There's discounted student plans. There's also discounts for other groups. So we do feel it's still the best deal in retail, and we just work to make it better and better each day. The second thing you mentioned is a good example. So the ability in 10 cities to get Prime Now deliveries of Whole Foods groceries is an added benefit for people in that market using Prime -- those markets using Prime Now. So as far as the Whole Foods, specifically on the question of what'll -- what we'll look at as far as expanding that grocery delivery, we're going to use the 10 cities as a test and see how customers respond, just like we always do, and make sure that our deliveries are great for those people, and then we'll announce expansion plans once we digest that, the feedback we get from customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heath Patrick Terry,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I was just wondering if you could give us a sense. The accelerating growth that we saw in the U.S. business in Q1, how much of that or how would you sort of segment that in terms of specific categories? Are there any specific categories that you would call out in terms of driving that? And then, as we look at the like acceleration in the AWS business, any sense that you can give us in terms of what volumes or customer you specifically call out sort of customer additions in some of your comments, what customer additions have looked like in terms of driving that business, particularly against sort of the comp against last year's price cuts?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. So first, with the -- you've mentioned North America revenue growth, and you can calculate that with and without the impact of Whole Foods, I'm sure, but the general drivers continues to be Prime and the Prime Flywheel, so we see strong customer demand, not only for the benefits that we associate with Prime, we're seeing better engagement with Prime Benefits, especially Digital and Benefits, and that is always good news for eventual sales of other things. We're also selling more subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited, multiple -- Kindle Unlimited, there's a number of services. So there's different revenue streams that we see. So not much more I can add by product line to North America. Now I talk about AWS revenue, again, we're -- we are accelerating. We've accelerated for the last 2 quarters. The FX-neutral growth was 48% in Q1, up from 44% on the same basis in Q4 and 42% in Q3. And now nearly a $22 billion run rate. So what we're seeing is just

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.\nFor opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.\nAs you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017.\nOur comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.\nOur guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions.

Sort of the state of conversations with advertisers, what product uptake you're seeing out in the marketplace? And sort of how that's looking now as we move out of '17 and into 2018, broadly, for the platform?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Yes. Sure, Eric. I would say, advertising continues to be a bright spot, both from a product standpoint, and also, financially. It was -- continued to be a strong contributor to profitability in Q1. It's now a multibillion-dollar program. You can see the -- in our supplemental revenue disclosure, it's in other revenue, and it's the majority of the other revenue in that line item. So we -- our philosophy there, again, is we're continuing to focus on finding valuable ways to make our advertising opportunities better for customers, showing them new products that they may not have seen otherwise, and also for emerging and established brands, helping them to reach customers. I think the advertisers, generally, are all shapes and sizes, and their common theme is they want to reach our customers, generally, to drive brand awareness, discovery, and eventually, purchase. Before I go on to the second question, I want to make a comment about the Prime program. Prime program continues to drive great strength in our top line, as you've seen over the last few years, actually. We continue to increase the value of Prime, including speed selection and digital entertainment options. We've been expanding FREE Same-Day Shipping and 1-day options. And our 2-day shipping, it's now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014. And we continue to add digital benefits, like Prime Video. The value of Prime to customers has never been greater. And the cost is also high. As we pointed out especially with shipping options and digital benefits, we continue to see rises in costs. So effective May 11, we're going to increase the price of our U.S. annual plan from $99 to $119, for new members. The new price will apply to renewals starting on June 16. Prime provides a unique combination of benefits, and we continue to invest in making this Prime program even more valuable for our members. As a reminder, we haven't increased the U.S. annual price Prime since our single increase, which was in March of 2014.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Yes. And Eric, sorry to just go back to your initial question too, just to hop back on that, I just want to remind folks that we've mentioned this last quarter on the call, but on January 1, we adopted an accounting standard update that amended our revenue recognition policies. So the net impact to revenue in the first quarter was not material, but I do want to highlight a few areas. As part of the adoption beginning in Q1, certain advertising services are classified as revenue, rather than a reduction of costs to sales. So the impact of this change was an increase of $560 million to other revenue in Q1, which is the other revenue was, of course, part of our supplemental sales disclosure. So you'll see that other revenue, in total, increased 132% ex FX year-over-year to about $2 billion in the first quarter, again, $560 million is included in there, and the majority of that is -- would be included in the North America segment. As you look at the other supplemental line items, just a few items of note. The line item online stores revenue increased about 13%, ex FX. Beginning in the first quarter, sales of apps, in-app content, certain digital media content, are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third-party seller services revenue, rather than net online stores revenue. So in the first quarter, online stores revenue would have been higher, but for this new standard. And then, the line item, subscription services revenue, that increased about 56% ex FX year-over-year. Prime members are -- Prime memberships are included in that line. Again, beginning in the first quarter, we now recognize annual Prime membership revenue straight line over the 12-month period. Prior to 2018, we recognize this revenue over the 12-month period with more revenue allocated to the fourth quarter each year. So in Q1 of this year's subscription services revenue would have been lower, but for this new standard.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          So the first one, on Prime, let me ask you this.

We're also selling more subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited, multiple -- Kindle Unlimited, there's a number of services. So there's different revenue streams that we see. So not much more I can add by product line to North America. Now I talk about AWS revenue, again, we're -- we are accelerating. We've accelerated for the last 2 quarters. The FX-neutral growth was 48% in Q1, up from 44% on the same basis in Q4 and 42% in Q3. And now nearly a $22 billion run rate. So what we're seeing is just ""}","Amazon.com Inc. reported strong Q1 2018 financial results, with accelerating revenue growth in both North America and AWS (Amazon Web Services) segments. The North America revenue growth was primarily driven by the Prime membership program, which continues to show strong customer demand and engagement with Prime benefits, leading to increased sales across various revenue streams such as digital and subscription services. 

AWS, the cloud services division, experienced accelerated growth for the last two quarters, with a year-over-year revenue growth of 48% in Q1. The total revenue for AWS reached almost $22 billion on an annual run rate basis. 

Advertising has emerged as a bright spot for Amazon, both in terms of product performance and financial contribution. The advertising program has become a multibillion-dollar program and continues to drive profitability. Amazon focuses on improving the advertising opportunities for customers, showing them new products, and helping emerging and established brands reach customers.

Regarding the Prime program, it remains a key driver of top-line growth for Amazon, offering increased value with faster shipping options, expanded selection, and digital entertainment options. However, due to rising costs associated with shipping and digital benefits, the company announced a price increase for its U.S. annual plan from $99 to $119, effective from May 11, 2018. This marks the first increase in U.S. annual price since March 2014.

In terms of revenue recognition, Amazon adopted a new accounting standard update in Q1 2018, which resulted in certain advertising services being classified as revenue instead of a reduction of costs to sales. This change increased the other revenue line item by $560 million in Q1. Additionally, sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are now presented on a net revenue basis, included in third-party seller services revenue rather than net online stores revenue, leading to a reduction in the online stores revenue line item.

As for future plans, Amazon expanded the Prime Now delivery service for Whole Foods groceries to 10 cities, and customer response will inform the company's decision on further roll-out. In terms of guidance, the company incorporates order trends and appropriate assumptions but acknowledges the inherent unpredictability of results, as they can be affected by various factors such as foreign exchange rates, global economic conditions, and customer spending.

Overall, Amazon.com Inc. demonstrated strong performance in Q1 2018 with revenue growth driven by the Prime membership program, advertising, and AWS. The company continues to invest in making the Prime program more valuable for members, while also focusing on improving advertising opportunities for customers and expanding the reach of Prime Now delivery services for Whole Foods groceries.",gpt-3

Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions)
Our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please state your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for taking the question. The international retail segment margin was the lowest we have seen in quite a while. I was hoping that you could provide some of the key drivers there in terms of the drag and any color on how to think about the incremental international investment that might be impacting the 4Q guide. Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. Thanks, Doug. Specifically to international, we are seeing expansion to support selection expansion fulfillment network increases. We're also investing in digital content and additional prime benefits, Fresh location and Prime Now. By far the biggest individual thing is the investment in India that we continue to make. Very excited about the initial reaction in India from both customers and also sellers. That is essentially the international margin guidance in Q4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gene Munster,  Piper Jaffray & Co. - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. Thanks. I guess when we think about the progression in margins in the second half versus the second half of 2015 and kind of the flat lining of overall margin at this point, excluding AWS, should we think about this as a temporary plateau that will at some point will resume once you start leveraging your fulfillment build-out or is there something structural that is philosophically changing with the way that you operate your business. Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, Gene. We will continue to invest in the business where we are seeing significant customer traction. The things that I'm about to mention fall into that category. The largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between the first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus second half of last year are the things that I mentioned on the call last quarter.
First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year over year in the second half of the year. It continues to be a large increase for both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter in Q3, we added 18 fulfillment centers and we have added 5 more in October. For the year, we will add 26. Most of those are in North America.
That compares to 14 last year and I would -- looking back, there is -- the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was 2012 when we added 11 in the third quarter. There was a rare aggregation of startups in Q3 and into Q4. It is helping us position better for Q4 volumes, because paid unit growth continues to be strong and Amazon fulfilled unit growth, which includes what we ship, includes FBA is significantly higher than even that. We are continuing to build for high AFN, or Amazon fulfilled network demand, including both retail and FBA.
The number of warehouses that we added represent the 30% increase in square footage year over year. Last year we increased square footage by just under 20%. The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses, plus our sortation and delivery centers, so it's pretty much our end-customer service centers. It's pretty much our square footage that support operations.
Those will dissipate as we -- as they burn in. We've talked about fulfillment centers initial startup costs include increase in fixed cost but also variable cost as we train workers and also bring in inventory. There's a number of transportation costs also related to the startup of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. They are inherently less efficient than more established, mature buildings. There will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017.
What you are seeing, essentially, in the second half of this year is a step-up investment, primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service rapid growth in that business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Nowak,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, just to go back, Brian, to the fulfillment build. In the past you talked about how it takes time to kind of get the fulfillment centers to peak efficiencies. With these new FCs opening, can you talk about if you become more efficient, so if you get into a lower volume quarter next year, there's less risk of deleverage or should we still think about it's going to take time to get up to peak efficiency?
The second one at AWS, Amazon the Company is good in removing friction in the purchase process. Can you talk about some of the main hurdles you have to overcome for large enterprises to start using AWS more? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. In the fulfillment network, as we build it yes, they will be more productive next year than this holiday peak and probably even more productive in 2018. I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity and additional costs in Q3 and even into Q4 of this year as we built the additional capacity. Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling, driven by our FBA program.
The FBA program is the key pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime stronger. That's a self-reinforcing loop where Prime -- the Prime success attracts more sellers. We're glad to have that problem. We are just working very hard to get capacity in place and productive use for Q4 and beyond.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, Brian. This is Darin. On the AWS question, we continue to invest in AWS on behalf of our customers. In addition to the technologies that make integrations easier and it helps companies move from an on-prem or a hybrid IT environment into AWS if we're going to continue to do that. Specifically, the database migration tool that are helpful for customers when they move production databases from on premises to the cloud with virtually no downtime.
Also, many of our AWS customers are beginning to choose and continue to choose the AWS schema conversion tool which really switches database engines to get out of old-guard proprietary databases and on to AWS. We will continue to react to customer needs and that will include opening up new regions. We have opened up Ohio this past quarter. We've highlighted that we will have a number of regions coming online in a few months. Yes, we're doing a lot of things to help make it easier for all customers to migrate to AWS.

Okay. Hey, Brian, would you give us any commentary on two categories in particular, groceries and fashion and apparel? Particularly on groceries, I know in the release there was a couple of data points about Fresh rolling out into newer areas like Maryland. Great to see that. Can you just talk about that in the investment horizon? Is that moving the needle for you and how big that -- any way to help us quantify how big that already is to your -- to the revenue growth that you're seeing, particularly on groceries and any particular comment on fashion and apparel. Same line of thinking. Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. Thanks, Mark. I will start with Fresh and groceries in general. Yes, this quarter we launched in Northern Virginia, Maryland, Dallas and Chicago. We also launched a new pricing plan, which is a monthly $14.99 add-on to Prime in the US. We have expanded, as you know, previously into London.
We're very happy with the progression both in the geographies that we have been in for a long time where we are at, continuing to add zip cod

Please state your question.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDouglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks for taking the question. The international retail segment margin was the lowest we have seen in quite a while. I was hoping that you could provide some of the key drivers there in terms of the drag and any color on how to think about the incremental international investment that might be impacting the 4Q guide. Thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSure. Thanks, Doug. Specifically to international, we are seeing expansion to support selection expansion fulfillment network increases. We're also investing in digital content and additional prime benefits, Fresh location and Prime Now. By far the biggest individual thing is the investment in India that we continue to make. Very excited about the initial reaction in India from both customers and also sellers. That is essentially the international margin guidance in Q4.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDouglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank you. Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGene Munster,  Piper Jaffray & Co. - Analyst    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGreat. Thanks. I guess when we think about the progression in margins in the second half versus the second half of 2015 and kind of the flat lining of overall margin at this point, excluding AWS, should we think about this as a temporary plateau that will at some point will resume once you start leveraging your fulfillment build-out or is there something structural that is philosophically changing with the way that you operate your business. Thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYes. Thanks, Gene. We will continue to invest in the business where we are seeing significant customer traction. The things that I'm about to mention fall into that category. The largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between the first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus second half of last year are the things that I mentioned on the call last quarter.\nFirst, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year over year in the second half of the year. It continues to be a large increase for both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter in Q3, we added 18 fulfillment centers and we have added 5 more in October. For the year, we will add 26. Most of those are in North America.\nThat compares to 14 last year and I would -- looking back, there is -- the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was 2012 when we added 11 in the third quarter. There was a rare aggregation of startups in Q3 and into Q4. It is helping us position better for Q4 volumes, because paid unit growth continues to be strong and Amazon fulfilled unit growth, which includes what we ship, includes FBA is significantly higher than even that. We are continuing to build for high AFN, or Amazon fulfilled network demand, including both retail and FBA.\nThe number of warehouses that we added represent the 30% increase in square footage year over year. Last year we increased square footage by just under 20%. The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses, plus our sortation and delivery centers, so it's pretty much our end-customer service centers. It's pretty much our square footage that support operations.\nThose will dissipate as we -- as they burn in. We've talked about fulfillment centers initial startup costs include increase in fixed cost but also variable cost as we train workers and also bring in inventory. There's a number of transportation costs also related to the startup of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. They are inherently less efficient than more established, mature buildings. There will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017.\nWhat you are seeing, essentially, in the second half of this year is a step-up investment, primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service rapid growth in that business.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Nowak,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, just to go back, Brian, to the fulfillment build. In the past you talked about how it takes time to kind of get the fulfillment centers to peak efficiencies. With these new FCs opening, can you talk about if you become more efficient, so if you get into a lower volume quarter next year, there's less risk of deleverage or should we still think about it's going to take time to get up to peak efficiency?\nThe second one at AWS, Amazon the Company is good in removing friction in the purchase process. Can you talk about some of the main hurdles you have to overcome for large enterprises to start using AWS more? Thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSure. In the fulfillment network, as we build it yes, they will be more productive next year than this holiday peak and probably even more productive in 2018. I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity and additional costs in Q3 and even into Q4 of this year as we built the additional capacity. Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling, driven by our FBA program.\nThe FBA program is the key pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime stronger. That's a self-reinforcing loop where Prime -- the Prime success attracts more sellers. We're glad to have that problem. We are just working very hard to get capacity in place and productive use for Q4 and beyond.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDarin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHi, Brian. This is Darin. On the AWS question, we continue to invest in AWS on behalf of our customers.

1. Investment and Impact on Margins:
   - Amazon is investing significantly in international expansion, which is impacting margins, specifically in the international retail segment. The company cites ""expansion to support selection expansion fulfillment network increases"" as well as investments in ""digital content and additional prime benefits, Fresh location and Prime Now"" as primary areas of investment.
   - The ""largest individual thing"" impacting the international margins is Amazon's investment in India. The company notes a positive initial reaction in India from both customers and sellers but does not provide specific quantitative data on this.
   - CFO Brian Olsavsky notes the investments lead to the lowest international segment margins seen in quite a while.

2. Content and Fulfillment Costs:
   - The second half of 2016 has seen nearly double the investment in video content and marketing year over year, contributing to a ""step-up investment.""
   - Amazon has added 18 fulfillment centers in Q3 plus 5 more in October, totaling 26 for the year, compared to 14 the previous year. This represents a 30% increase in square footage year over year (last year was under 20%). The costs associated include increased fixed costs and variable costs, such as worker training and inventory stocking. 

3. AWS (Amazon Web Services) Growth and Customer Integration:
   - AWS growth factors include adding more personnel to support the growth of services.
   - Tools like the database migration tool and AWS schema conversion tool are being invested in to facilitate easier migration of customer databases from on-premises to the cloud.
   - New regions for AWS are expanding, with Ohio recently launched and more regions planned.

4. Revenue Drivers:
   - Amazon Prime and services related to it, such as Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), are key revenue drivers with increased unit growth mentioned.
   - Amazon Fresh, the grocery service, has expanded to additional markets including Northern Virginia, Maryland, Dallas, and Chicago and has launched a new pricing plan of $14.99 per month as an add-on to Prime in the U.S.

5. Forward-Looking Statements and Guidance:
   - The company's guidance is based on order trends observed to date and ""appropriate assumptions."" However, results are said to be unpredictable and can be affected by various factors like foreign exchange rates and global economic conditions.
   - The guidance assumes no additional business acquisitions, investment restructurings, or legal settlements and clarifies that actual results could materially differ from guidance due to unpredictable demand for goods and services.

The context around these findings includes a cautious approach to forward-looking statements, emphasizing the uncertain nature of predictions due to numerous factors that could impact financial results. Investments in international expansion (particularly in India), digital content, and the build-out of fulfillment centers are seen as necessary steps for long-term growth but come with short-term costs that are impacting current margins. Notably, there is no explicit guidance provided in terms of revenue, earnings, or specific growth rates for the upcoming periods.",gpt-4

Please state your question.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDouglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks for taking the question. The international retail segment margin was the lowest we have seen in quite a while. I was hoping that you could provide some of the key drivers there in terms of the drag and any color on how to think about the incremental international investment that might be impacting the 4Q guide. Thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSure. Thanks, Doug. Specifically to international, we are seeing expansion to support selection expansion fulfillment network increases. We're also investing in digital content and additional prime benefits, Fresh location and Prime Now. By far the biggest individual thing is the investment in India that we continue to make. Very excited about the initial reaction in India from both customers and also sellers. That is essentially the international margin guidance in Q4.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDouglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank you. Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGene Munster,  Piper Jaffray & Co. - Analyst    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGreat. Thanks. I guess when we think about the progression in margins in the second half versus the second half of 2015 and kind of the flat lining of overall margin at this point, excluding AWS, should we think about this as a temporary plateau that will at some point will resume once you start leveraging your fulfillment build-out or is there something structural that is philosophically changing with the way that you operate your business. Thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYes. Thanks, Gene. We will continue to invest in the business where we are seeing significant customer traction. The things that I'm about to mention fall into that category. The largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between the first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus second half of last year are the things that I mentioned on the call last quarter.\nFirst, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year over year in the second half of the year. It continues to be a large increase for both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter in Q3, we added 18 fulfillment centers and we have added 5 more in October. For the year, we will add 26. Most of those are in North America.\nThat compares to 14 last year and I would -- looking back, there is -- the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was 2012 when we added 11 in the third quarter. There was a rare aggregation of startups in Q3 and into Q4. It is helping us position better for Q4 volumes, because paid unit growth continues to be strong and Amazon fulfilled unit growth, which includes what we ship, includes FBA is significantly higher than even that. We are continuing to build for high AFN, or Amazon fulfilled network demand, including both retail and FBA.\nThe number of warehouses that we added represent the 30% increase in square footage year over year. Last year we increased square footage by just under 20%. The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses, plus our sortation and delivery centers, so it's pretty much our end-customer service centers. It's pretty much our square footage that support operations.\nThose will dissipate as we -- as they burn in. We've talked about fulfillment centers initial startup costs include increase in fixed cost but also variable cost as we train workers and also bring in inventory. There's a number of transportation costs also related to the startup of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. They are inherently less efficient than more established, mature buildings. There will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017.\nWhat you are seeing, essentially, in the second half of this year is a step-up investment, primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service rapid growth in that business.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Nowak,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, just to go back, Brian, to the fulfillment build. In the past you talked about how it takes time to kind of get the fulfillment centers to peak efficiencies. With these new FCs opening, can you talk about if you become more efficient, so if you get into a lower volume quarter next year, there's less risk of deleverage or should we still think about it's going to take time to get up to peak efficiency?\nThe second one at AWS, Amazon the Company is good in removing friction in the purchase process. Can you talk about some of the main hurdles you have to overcome for large enterprises to start using AWS more? Thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSure. In the fulfillment network, as we build it yes, they will be more productive next year than this holiday peak and probably even more productive in 2018. I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity and additional costs in Q3 and even into Q4 of this year as we built the additional capacity. Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling, driven by our FBA program.\nThe FBA program is the key pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime stronger. That's a self-reinforcing loop where Prime -- the Prime success attracts more sellers. We're glad to have that problem. We are just working very hard to get capacity in place and productive use for Q4 and beyond.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDarin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHi, Brian. This is Darin. On the AWS question, we continue to invest in AWS on behalf of our customers. In addition to the technologies that make integrations easier and it helps companies move from an on-prem or a hybrid IT environment into AWS if we're going to continue to do that. Specifically, the database migration tool that are helpful for customers when they move production databases from on premises to the cloud with virtually no downtime.\nAlso, many of our AWS customers are beginning to choose and continue to choose the AWS schema conversion tool which really switches database engines to get out of old-guard proprietary databases and on to AWS. We will continue to react to customer needs and that will include opening up new regions. We have opened up Ohio this past quarter. We've highlighted that we will have a number of regions coming online in a few months. Yes, we're doing a lot of things to help make it easier for all customers to migrate to AWS.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [12]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [13]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOkay. Hey, Brian, would you give us any commentary on two categories in particular, groceries and fashion and apparel? Particularly on groceries, I know in the release there was a couple of data points about Fresh rolling out into newer areas like Maryland. Great to see that. Can you just talk about that in the investment horizon? Is that moving the needle for you and how big that -- any way to help us quantify how big that already is to your -- to the revenue growth that you're seeing, particularly on groceries and any particular comment on fashion and apparel. Same line of thinking. Thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [14]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSure. Thanks, Mark. I will start with Fresh and groceries in general. Yes, this quarter we launched in Northern Virginia, Maryland, Dallas and Chicago. We also launched a new pricing plan, which is a monthly $14.99 add-on to Prime in the US. We have expanded, as you know, previously into London.\nWe're very happy with the progression both in the geographies that we have been in for a long time where we are at, continuing to add zip cod""}","In the Q3 2016 earnings call transcript of Amazon.com Inc, CFO Brian Olsavsky highlighted several key factors influencing the company's performance. In terms of revenue drivers, Olsavsky mentioned that the international retail segment margin was lower due to investments in expansion, fulfillment network, digital content, and additional Prime benefits, particularly in India. He expressed excitement about the initial reaction in India from both customers and sellers.

Regarding cost savings, Olsavsky noted that the investment in fulfillment centers, digital content, and other areas will lead to productivity improvements in the future. However, he also mentioned that there are initial startup costs associated with fulfillment centers, including both fixed and variable costs, as well as transportation costs related to inbound and outbound logistics. These costs are expected to dissipate as the fulfillment centers become more established and efficient.

The CFO discussed the importance of the FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) program, which is a key pillar of the Prime offering. The FBA program adds selection and strengthens the Prime ecosystem, attracting more sellers. Olsavsky highlighted the company's efforts to increase capacity to meet the demand generated by the FBA program.

Furthermore, Olsavsky provided insights into AWS (Amazon Web Services), mentioning that the company continues to invest in technologies that facilitate integrations and help companies migrate from on-premises or hybrid IT environments to the AWS cloud. The company is also opening up new regions and providing tools to assist with database migrations and conversions.

In terms of specific categories, Olsavsky mentioned the progress of the Fresh and groceries business. Amazon expanded its Fresh service into Northern Virginia, Maryland, Dallas, and Chicago and introduced a new pricing plan. Olsavsky expressed satisfaction with the progression of the business, both in existing geographies and in new markets like London.

In summary, Amazon.com Inc's Q3 2016 earnings call transcript highlighted key revenue drivers such as expansion, fulfillment network investments, and digital content. The company expressed enthusiasm about its performance in India and the growth opportunities in the Fresh and groceries business. Investments in AWS and the FBA program were also emphasized, along with the expectation of future productivity improvements in fulfillment centers.",gpt-3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2016 financial results teleconference.
(Operator Instructions)
Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello and welcome to our Q4 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 2, 2017 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we have seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors. Including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And just briefly before we move to questions, I would like to address our Form 10-K that we will be filing with the SEC. We received a comment letter from the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance regarding our 2015 Form 10-K, and have subsequently been engaged with the SEC staff regarding our disclosures.
We will be revising the disclosures of net, product and service sales in our Form 10-K. As a result, we expect to file our 2016 Form 10-K later than we typically have, but before the SEC's due date of March 1. These changes relate to our entity-wide disclosures and do not impact the financial results that we report for the Company or our segments.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

John Blackledge,  Cowen and Company - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great, thanks for the question. So the first quarter GAAP operating income guide essentially implies negative incremental margins at the low, mid and high end of guidance. So just wondering if you can frame in order of possible the investment areas that are driving the negative incremental margins, and then just generally how should we think about the margin profile in 2017? Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, John. First, let me talk about revenue just to get that out there as well.
We are guiding to 17% to 25% growth on an FX-neutral basis. That includes approximately -- on top of that is approximately 250 basis points or $730 million of FX negative impact, which brings the non-FX adjusted range down to 14% to 23%.
I will also point out we that had the Leap Year comp from last year. Last year, the extra day of Leap Year was worth 150 basis points to us in our Q1 revenue. This year that reverses, so we have 150 basis point headwind to growth and it's been factored into our guidance range.
But your question was on bottom line. So yes, what you are seeing, John, is the continuation of the step-up investment that we saw in the second half of last year. I talked about in prior calls about the fulfillment center step up.
We had 26 warehouses we added last year, 23 of them were in the second half of the year. Digital content, digital video content, end marketing stepped up quite a bit in the second half of the year.
We continue to invest heavily in those two areas. We also have investments in other Prime benefits from Prime Now to Amazon Fresh, and of course we're continuing to invest in Alexa in our Echo devices. And finally I'd point out India which continues to be a rather large investment for us.

          Scott Devitt, Stifel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott Devitt,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, thank you. The question is on video. I was wondering if you could just give any quantification in terms of the magnitude of video spend in 2017, as well as the lumpiness from an expensing standpoint quarterly?
And then separately as it relates to just the video service. From a positioning standpoint in the market, how do you think about the unique aspects of the product that Amazon has relative to others in the market in terms of is the aggregation tools that are being provided now where some of the value is being perceived longer term?
Is it the uniqueness of the content or is it other things? If you could provide a little bit of color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc. - CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well ultimately, I will step back and say one of the main things we look at on Prime Video is customer usage patterns. And in 2016, we had a doubling of Prime hours for video, music and reading. So we are happy with the engagement that customers have.
We're also happy with the -- especially on the studio side, the people we have been able to work with. Some of the most talented people in the entertainment industry. And our customers have responded really well to the shows that we have created. We have garnered awards of course, but mainly what we were focused on is good content that is attractive to customers.
I will also point out that we rolled out the global Prime Video offer in the second half of last -- in Q4, and what we see there is again original content is a fixed cost expense. The more we can amortize it over a large base, the better off we will be. But more importantly, we have great content that we want to share with people outside of our primary retail countries and this takes us to over 200 more countries.
So we are very happy with the results in video. Yes, the investment did step up in the second half of last year, including marketing and that will continue in 2017 and likely beyond.

          Can you discuss what you're doing to help merchants in China sell and ship directly to consumers in the US and other developed economies, and how the business has been evolving over time? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Darin Manney,  Amazon.com Inc. - Director of IR    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, Ben. This is Darin. We are very pleased with our FBA offering, and that's really helpful to sellers around the world. Certainly, our international sellers have access to more and more customers through that offering, and that doesn't exclude sellers in China as well.
The offering in China that we have for consumers is also a great trusted customer engagement. We have a very strong and trusted venue for Chinese customers to access international brands there, as we continue to focus on great offerings through the Amazon global store which offers great brands from outside of China to customers. And so there is a mix of things going on in China, and we're happy with what we are seeing in both of those.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you. A follow up on India and China. I know you are investing a lot, I'd love to hear how much but you probably won't tell us.
But can you tell us why you think the market is worth investment, and what really attracts you to the market as you think out longer term? And then China, can you give us any updates there on how financial performance is doing, and if you have changed your strategy and if anything has gotten better there this year? Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc. - CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Let me start with India. So it's still very early. We continue to say that, but we're very encouraged with what we have created with customers and sellers alike in India over the last few years.
We continue to develop new functionality for that country, whether it's delivery, whether it's seller features. We rolled out Prime last summer, if you'll remember, and we recently launched Prime Video there.
So we've had success with Prime in every country we've been in, we don't expect India to be any different. We will continue to build our business there, and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers. We are bullish on India longer term, and it's early but we like the initial engagement we are seeing and the response again from both customers and sellers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Darin Manney,  Amazon.com Inc. - Director of IR    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And this is Darin. On China, like I said, we are very pleased with our offering in China. Our strategy there has been one of bringing a trusted and authentic product to customers in China, both domestically and from international offers.
So we will continue to focus on the global store there. As you may know, we've launched the Prime program that's focused around the availability of international goods in China, and we are pleased with what we are seeing there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heath Terry,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. Two primary questions. Can you give us a sense of what the best way to think about the impact that the shift to third-party? And within that the growth in FBA is having on these sequential growth rates?
To the extent that there is 150 basis point impact from Leap Year on a year-over-year basis, is there a way to quantify the impact that that shift to third p

Including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.\nAnd just briefly before we move to questions, I would like to address our Form 10-K that we will be filing with the SEC. We received a comment letter from the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance regarding our 2015 Form 10-K, and have subsequently been engaged with the SEC staff regarding our disclosures.\nWe will be revising the disclosures of net, product and service sales in our Form 10-K. As a result, we expect to file our 2016 Form 10-K later than we typically have, but before the SEC's due date of March 1. These changes relate to our entity-wide disclosures and do not impact the financial results that we report for the Company or our segments.\nWith that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\n\n\n================================================================================\nQuestions and Answers\n================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          (Operator Instructions)\nJohn Blackledge, Cowen.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJohn Blackledge,  Cowen and Company - Analyst    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Great, thanks for the question. So the first quarter GAAP operating income guide essentially implies negative incremental margins at the low, mid and high end of guidance. So just wondering if you can frame in order of possible the investment areas that are driving the negative incremental margins, and then just generally how should we think about the margin profile in 2017? Thank you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc. - CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thank you, John. First, let me talk about revenue just to get that out there as well.\nWe are guiding to 17% to 25% growth on an FX-neutral basis. That includes approximately -- on top of that is approximately 250 basis points or $730 million of FX negative impact, which brings the non-FX adjusted range down to 14% to 23%.\nI will also point out we that had the Leap Year comp from last year. Last year, the extra day of Leap Year was worth 150 basis points to us in our Q1 revenue. This year that reverses, so we have 150 basis point headwind to growth and it's been factored into our guidance range.\nBut your question was on bottom line. So yes, what you are seeing, John, is the continuation of the step-up investment that we saw in the second half of last year. I talked about in prior calls about the fulfillment center step up.\nWe had 26 warehouses we added last year, 23 of them were in the second half of the year. Digital content, digital video content, end marketing stepped up quite a bit in the second half of the year.\nWe continue to invest heavily in those two areas. We also have investments in other Prime benefits from Prime Now to Amazon Fresh, and of course we're continuing to invest in Alexa in our Echo devices. And finally I'd point out India which continues to be a rather large investment for us.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Scott Devitt, Stifel.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScott Devitt,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Hello, thank you. The question is on video. I was wondering if you could just give any quantification in terms of the magnitude of video spend in 2017, as well as the lumpiness from an expensing standpoint quarterly?\nAnd then separately as it relates to just the video service. From a positioning standpoint in the market, how do you think about the unique aspects of the product that Amazon has relative to others in the market in terms of is the aggregation tools that are being provided now where some of the value is being perceived longer term?\nIs it the uniqueness of the content or is it other things? If you could provide a little bit of color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc. - CFO    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Well ultimately, I will step back and say one of the main things we look at on Prime Video is customer usage patterns. And in 2016, we had a doubling of Prime hours for video, music and reading. So we are happy with the engagement that customers have.\nWe're also happy with the -- especially on the studio side, the people we have been able to work with. Some of the most talented people in the entertainment industry. And our customers have responded really well to the shows that we have created. We have garnered awards of course, but mainly what we were focused on is good content that is attractive to customers.\nI will also point out that we rolled out the global Prime Video offer in the second half of last -- in Q4, and what we see there is again original content is a fixed cost expense. The more we can amortize it over a large base, the better off we will be. But more importantly, we have great content that we want to share with people outside of our primary retail countries and this takes us to over 200 more countries.\nSo we are very happy with the results in video. Yes, the investment did step up in the second half of last year, including marketing and that will continue in 2017 and likely beyond.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Ben Schachter, Macquarie.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBen Schachter,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Can you discuss what you're doing to help merchants in China sell and ship directly to consumers in the US and other developed economies, and how the business has been evolving over time? Thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDarin Manney,  Amazon.com Inc. - Director of IR    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Hello, Ben. This is Darin. We are very pleased with our FBA offering, and that's really helpful to sellers around the world. Certainly, our international sellers have access to more and more customers through that offering, and that doesn't exclude sellers in China as well.\nThe offering in China that we have for consumers is also a great trusted customer engagement. We have a very strong and trusted venue for Chinese customers to access international brands there, as we continue to focus on great offerings through the Amazon global store which offers great brands from outside of China to customers. And so there is a mix of things going on in China, and we're happy with what we are seeing in both of those.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Justin Post, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJustin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thank you. A follow up on India and China. I know you are investing a lot, I'd love to hear how much but you probably won't tell us.\nBut can you tell us why you think the market is worth investment, and what really attracts you to the market as you think out longer term? And then China, can you give us any updates there on how financial performance is doing, and if you have changed your strategy and if anything has gotten better there this year? Thank you\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc. - CFO    [12]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Let me start with India. So it's still very early. We continue to say that, but we're very encouraged with what we have created with customers and sellers alike in India over the last few years.\nWe continue to develop new functionality for that country, whether it's delivery, whether it's seller features. We rolled out Prime last summer, if you'll remember, and we recently launched Prime Video there.\nSo we've had success with Prime in every country we've been in, we don't expect India to be any different. We will continue to build our business there, and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers. We are bullish on India longer term, and it's early but we like the initial engagement we are seeing and the response again from both customers and sellers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDarin Manney,  Amazon.com Inc. - Director of IR    [13]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          And this is Darin. On China, like I said, we are very pleased with our offering in China. Our strategy there has been one of bringing a trusted and authentic product to customers in China, both domestically and from international offers.\nSo we will continue to focus on the global store there. As you may know, we've launched the Prime program that's focused around the availability of international goods in China, and we are pleased with what we are seeing there.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [14]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Heath Terry, Goldman Sachs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHeath Terry,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [15]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Great. Two primary questions. Can you give us a sense of what the best way to think about the impact that the shift to third-party? And within that the growth in FBA is having on these sequential growth rates?\nTo the extent that there is 150 basis point impact from Leap Year on a year-over-year basis, is there a way to quantify the impact that that shift to third p""}","In Amazon.com Inc.'s Q4 2016 earnings call, several vital aspects of the company's financial performance and strategic outlook were detailed by CFO Brian Olsavsky and Director of IR Darin Manney. Here's a thematic breakdown with provided quantitative data:

**Guidance and Investment Focus:**
- The forecast for Q1 revenue growth was 17% to 25% on an FX-neutral basis, affected by a headwind due to a 250 basis points or $730 million forex impact, and adjusted to 14% to 23% growth when non-FX adjusted.
- The guidance accounts for the 2016 Leap Year, which provided a benefit to Q1 2016 revenue by 150 basis points but is a reversal and thus a headwind in Q1 2017 growth by the same margin.

**Operational Investments and Margin Pressure:**
- Amazon is continuing substantial investment in various business segments. Specifically, investments in fulfillment centers, digital content, Amazon Fresh, Prime Now, Alexa, Echo devices, and particularly in India, contribute to a lower operating income and negative incremental margins guidance for Q1.
- The company opened 26 new fulfillment centers in 2016, 23 of which were in the second half of the year, leading to increased spending.
- Digital video content in particular has seen a doubling in Prime hours for video, which points to extensive customer engagement and further investment.
- Investments are also aimed at global expansion, with the launch of the global Prime Video offer in Q4 2016, extending Amazon's original content to over 200 countries around the world.

**International Market Focus - India and China:**
- Amazon views the Indian market as early stage but is encouraged by initial customer and seller engagement, indicating a positive response to Prime and Prime Video in India.
- The company continues to build functionalities for the Indian market such as delivery and seller features and remains optimistic about the long-term potential in India.
- In China, the emphasis is on offering a mix of domestic and international items while focusing on a trusted venue for Chinese consumers to access international brands through the Amazon global store. The company has introduced international goods-focused Prime membership in China, with a positive reception observed.

**Third-Party Sellers and Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA):**
- The call did not provide explicit quantitative data regarding the growth in third-party sellers and the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program's specific impact on financials.
- However, the discussion suggested that international sellers, including those from China, are increasingly using FBA to reach a broader customer base.
- The transcript also alluded to how the shift towards third-party sellers and the growing use of FBA are influencing growth rates, although no specific figures were shared.

**Reporting Adjustments:**
- Amazon will be revising disclosures of net, product, and service sales in its Form 10-K due to an SEC comment on their 2015 filing. The company plans to file its 2016 Form 10-K later than usual, but before the SEC's March 1 deadline. These changes are related to entity-wide disclosures and do not impact the reported financial results for the company or its segments.

**Other Aspects:**
- The narrative of the call did not delve into specifics on areas such as cost savings, macroeconomic environment, post-synergies from mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, capital structure, future capital transactions, debt, hedges, liquidity, or detailed operating expenses, and therefore those are not included in the summary.",gpt-4

          Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2016 financial results teleconference.
(Operator Instructions)
Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello and welcome to our Q4 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 2, 2017 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we have seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors. Including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And just briefly before we move to questions, I would like to address our Form 10-K that we will be filing with the SEC. We received a comment letter from the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance regarding our 2015 Form 10-K, and have subsequently been engaged with the SEC staff regarding our disclosures.
We will be revising the disclosures of net, product and service sales in our Form 10-K. As a result, we expect to file our 2016 Form 10-K later than we typically have, but before the SEC's due date of March 1.

Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\n\n\n================================================================================\nQuestions and Answers\n================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          (Operator Instructions)\nJohn Blackledge, Cowen.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJohn Blackledge,  Cowen and Company - Analyst    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Great, thanks for the question. So the first quarter GAAP operating income guide essentially implies negative incremental margins at the low, mid and high end of guidance. So just wondering if you can frame in order of possible the investment areas that are driving the negative incremental margins, and then just generally how should we think about the margin profile in 2017? Thank you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc. - CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thank you, John. First, let me talk about revenue just to get that out there as well.\nWe are guiding to 17% to 25% growth on an FX-neutral basis. That includes approximately -- on top of that is approximately 250 basis points or $730 million of FX negative impact, which brings the non-FX adjusted range down to 14% to 23%.\nI will also point out we that had the Leap Year comp from last year. Last year, the extra day of Leap Year was worth 150 basis points to us in our Q1 revenue. This year that reverses, so we have 150 basis point headwind to growth and it's been factored into our guidance range.\nBut your question was on bottom line. So yes, what you are seeing, John, is the continuation of the step-up investment that we saw in the second half of last year. I talked about in prior calls about the fulfillment center step up.\nWe had 26 warehouses we added last year, 23 of them were in the second half of the year. Digital content, digital video content, end marketing stepped up quite a bit in the second half of the year.\nWe continue to invest heavily in those two areas. We also have investments in other Prime benefits from Prime Now to Amazon Fresh, and of course we're continuing to invest in Alexa in our Echo devices. And finally I'd point out India which continues to be a rather large investment for us.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Scott Devitt, Stifel.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScott Devitt,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Hello, thank you. The question is on video. I was wondering if you could just give any quantification in terms of the magnitude of video spend in 2017, as well as the lumpiness from an expensing standpoint quarterly?\nAnd then separately as it relates to just the video service. From a positioning standpoint in the market, how do you think about the unique aspects of the product that Amazon has relative to others in the market in terms of is the aggregation tools that are being provided now where some of the value is being perceived longer term?\nIs it the uniqueness of the content or is it other things? If you could provide a little bit of color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc. - CFO    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Well ultimately, I will step back and say one of the main things we look at on Prime Video is customer usage patterns. And in 2016, we had a doubling of Prime hours for video, music and reading. So we are happy with the engagement that customers have.\nWe're also happy with the -- especially on the studio side, the people we have been able to work with. Some of the most talented people in the entertainment industry. And our customers have responded really well to the shows that we have created. We have garnered awards of course, but mainly what we were focused on is good content that is attractive to customers.\nI will also point out that we rolled out the global Prime Video offer in the second half of last -- in Q4, and what we see there is again original content is a fixed cost expense. The more we can amortize it over a large base, the better off we will be. But more importantly, we have great content that we want to share with people outside of our primary retail countries and this takes us to over 200 more countries.\nSo we are very happy with the results in video. Yes, the investment did step up in the second half of last year, including marketing and that will continue in 2017 and likely beyond.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Ben Schachter, Macquarie.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBen Schachter,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Can you discuss what you're doing to help merchants in China sell and ship directly to consumers in the US and other developed economies, and how the business has been evolving over time? Thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDarin Manney,  Amazon.com Inc. - Director of IR    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Hello, Ben. This is Darin. We are very pleased with our FBA offering, and that's really helpful to sellers around the world. Certainly, our international sellers have access to more and more customers through that offering, and that doesn't exclude sellers in China as well.\nThe offering in China that we have for consumers is also a great trusted customer engagement. We have a very strong and trusted venue for Chinese customers to access international brands there, as we continue to focus on great offerings through the Amazon global store which offers great brands from outside of China to customers. And so there is a mix of things going on in China, and we're happy with what we are seeing in both of those.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Justin Post, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJustin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thank you. A follow up on India and China. I know you are investing a lot, I'd love to hear how much but you probably won't tell us.\nBut can you tell us why you think the market is worth investment, and what really attracts you to the market as you think out longer term? And then China, can you give us any updates there on how financial performance is doing, and if you have changed your strategy and if anything has gotten better there this year? Thank you\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc. - CFO    [12]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Let me start with India. So it's still very early. We continue to say that, but we're very encouraged with what we have created with customers and sellers alike in India over the last few years.\nWe continue to develop new functionality for that country, whether it's delivery, whether it's seller features. We rolled out Prime last summer, if you'll remember, and we recently launched Prime Video there.\nSo we've had success with Prime in every country we've been in, we don't expect India to be any different. We will continue to build our business there, and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers. We are bullish on India longer term, and it's early but we like the initial engagement we are seeing and the response again from both customers and sellers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDarin Manney,  Amazon.com Inc. - Director of IR    [13]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          And this is Darin. On China, like I said, we are very pleased with our offering in China. Our strategy there has been one of bringing a trusted and authentic product to customers in China, both domestically and from international offers.\nSo we will continue to focus on the global store there. As you may know, we've launched the Prime program that's focused around the availability of international goods in China, and we are pleased with what we are seeing there.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [14]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Heath Terry, Goldman Sachs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHeath Terry,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [15]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Great. Two primary questions. Can you give us a sense of what the best way to think about the impact that the shift to third-party? And within that the growth in FBA is having on these sequential growth rates?\nTo the extent that there is 150 basis point impact from Leap Year on a year-over-year basis, is there a way to quantify the impact that that shift to third p""}","Key insights from the Amazon Q4 2016 earnings call transcript include:

After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Darin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello and welcome to our Q2 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and the responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today July 28, 2016, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on form 10K and subsequent filings.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. Now I will turn the call over to Brian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Darin. I'll begin with comments on our second-quarter financial results.
Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 42% to $12.7 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $4.4 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow, less lease principal repayments, increased to $3.9 billion, up from $2.4 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow, less financed lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases, increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $492 million.
Worldwide revenue increased 31% to $30.4 billion or 30% excluding the $166 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 28%. Worldwide seller units represented 49% of paid units.
Now I will talk about our segment results. North America revenue grew 28% to $17.7 billion. North America operating income was $702 million, a 4% operating margin, compared with $348 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
International revenue grew 30% to $9.8 billion. Excluding the $184 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. International operating loss was $135 million, compared with a loss of $189 million in the prior year. This includes $40 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Amazon Web Services revenue grew 58% to $2.9 billion. Amazon Web Services operating income was $718 million, a 24.9% operating margin, compared with $305 million in the prior year. Our operating income was $1.3 billion, or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year over year. This includes $45 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Net income was $857 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, compared with the net income of $92 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. For Q3 2016, we expect net sales of between $31 billion and $33.5 billion, or growth of between 22% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $50 million and $650 million, compared with $406 million in third quarter 2015.
We are grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks, and with that I will hand it back to Darin.
Thank you, Brian. Before we move to questions I need to remind you that our guidance incorporates the order trend that we've seen to date, and what we believe to be appropriate assumptions.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes that we do not conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.
(Operation Instructions)
Thank you. Our first question is from Mark May of Citi. Please proceed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for taking my question. We've noticed some data points out there that suggest that you're accelerating your build-out of fulfillment capacity in North America and obviously also in India. Can you give us a sense of what sort of impact that, that might have in the near to mid-term on your CapEx, depreciation and ultimately CSOI? Especially as it relates to your Q3 guidance? And then just a maintenance question, how much is FX impacting your Q3 guidance? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thanks, Mark. Yes, let me talk a little bit about guidance, and I'll incorporate the answer to the fulfillment question. So, you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later. But Prime Day was very successful for us. It was up 60% on a worldwide basis over the prior year, and it was also a record day for our Amazon devices, as well as sellers and customers alike.
In the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is a typically a lower operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holiday peak. It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter. To put that in perspective, we launched six in Q3 of last year. This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3, and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first three quarters of last year on a net basis. So, why are we expanding so much? If you remember back to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really strong FBA growth, we talked a lot in the Q4 call about the operational cost of that in Q4. Customers are well taken care of, but we had additional fulfillment costs from being so tight on capacity.
This year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we are - Q2 was 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by - units fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA. That compares with last year in Q2 when we saw 22% unit growth. So we're 600 basis points faster growth in Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year turned into 26% in Q4. So it ramped up in the back end of the year.
So a lot of data points there, but the bottom line is that there's a large step up in the amount of fulfillment capacity in Q2 - excuse me, Q3 versus Q2. There's a couple of other factors while I'm at it for guidance. We are also nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2015. We have a great slate of new Amazon Originals coming out later this year, both in the US and internationally, and we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon Original shows - TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year. There are other investments, certainly, that are increasing sequentially. I'd point to India and AWS, but primarily the two biggest issues in Q3 guidance I would say are the operational ramp and also the increase in digital content spend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Darin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And, Mark, to follow up on the other question, our net sales guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And, Brian, where does that bring your video content spend to with the doubling in the second half if we look at it on an annualized basis?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're not disclosing that at this time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Please state your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to go back to Prime Day for a minute. I didn't hear any commentary around new Prime members in particular. Obviously a lot of other metrics that you gave but hoping you could provide a little bit more color around that.
And then also, is there anything else that stood out in terms of what you learned around operations and systems ahead of the holiday season? And then just going back to the 3Q guide, what's the right way for us to think about stock-based comp in the third quarter and if we looked at your 2Q numbers, is that a fair assumption for what you're thinking about? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. Let me circle back on Prime Day. So again, it was the biggest global day ever for Amazon and was up 60% on a order product sales basis versus Prime Day 2015. It was a record day for Amazon devices. It was a great day for small businesses and sellers who saw great year-over improvement in their sales. And more importantly, it was a great day for customers. Globally they saved over double what they had saved in Prime Day 2015.
So we're very pleased with the results of Prime Day, and the impact of Prime Day is factored into this guidance. As far as new customers and new Prime members, we're not disclosing that, but suffice to say that it was a great day for both existing Prime members and also new customers who were trying us out for the first time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Darin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And on the stock-based compensation, you'll recall beginning in Q1 this year, we began allocating stock-based com

Before we move to questions I need to remind you that our guidance incorporates the order trend that we've seen to date, and what we believe to be appropriate assumptions.\nOur results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance also assumes that we do not conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.\nWith that let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\n\n\n================================================================================\nQuestions and Answers\n================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAt this time, we will now open the call up for questions. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.\n(Operation Instructions)\nThank you. Our first question is from Mark May of Citi. Please proceed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks for taking my question. We've noticed some data points out there that suggest that you're accelerating your build-out of fulfillment capacity in North America and obviously also in India. Can you give us a sense of what sort of impact that, that might have in the near to mid-term on your CapEx, depreciation and ultimately CSOI? Especially as it relates to your Q3 guidance? And then just a maintenance question, how much is FX impacting your Q3 guidance? Thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOkay. Thanks, Mark. Yes, let me talk a little bit about guidance, and I'll incorporate the answer to the fulfillment question. So, you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later. But Prime Day was very successful for us. It was up 60% on a worldwide basis over the prior year, and it was also a record day for our Amazon devices, as well as sellers and customers alike.\nIn the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is a typically a lower operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holiday peak. It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter. To put that in perspective, we launched six in Q3 of last year. This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3, and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first three quarters of last year on a net basis. So, why are we expanding so much? If you remember back to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really strong FBA growth, we talked a lot in the Q4 call about the operational cost of that in Q4. Customers are well taken care of, but we had additional fulfillment costs from being so tight on capacity.\nThis year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we are - Q2 was 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by - units fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA. That compares with last year in Q2 when we saw 22% unit growth. So we're 600 basis points faster growth in Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year turned into 26% in Q4. So it ramped up in the back end of the year.\nSo a lot of data points there, but the bottom line is that there's a large step up in the amount of fulfillment capacity in Q2 - excuse me, Q3 versus Q2. There's a couple of other factors while I'm at it for guidance. We are also nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2015. We have a great slate of new Amazon Originals coming out later this year, both in the US and internationally, and we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon Original shows - TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year. There are other investments, certainly, that are increasing sequentially. I'd point to India and AWS, but primarily the two biggest issues in Q3 guidance I would say are the operational ramp and also the increase in digital content spend.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDarin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd, Mark, to follow up on the other question, our net sales guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd, Brian, where does that bring your video content spend to with the doubling in the second half if we look at it on an annualized basis?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe're not disclosing that at this time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Please state your question.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDouglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks for taking the questions. I just want to go back to Prime Day for a minute. I didn't hear any commentary around new Prime members in particular. Obviously a lot of other metrics that you gave but hoping you could provide a little bit more color around that.\nAnd then also, is there anything else that stood out in terms of what you learned around operations and systems ahead of the holiday season? And then just going back to the 3Q guide, what's the right way for us to think about stock-based comp in the third quarter and if we looked at your 2Q numbers, is that a fair assumption for what you're thinking about? Thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSure. Let me circle back on Prime Day. So again, it was the biggest global day ever for Amazon and was up 60% on a order product sales basis versus Prime Day 2015. It was a record day for Amazon devices. It was a great day for small businesses and sellers who saw great year-over improvement in their sales. And more importantly, it was a great day for customers. Globally they saved over double what they had saved in Prime Day 2015.\nSo we're very pleased with the results of Prime Day, and the impact of Prime Day is factored into this guidance. As far as new customers and new Prime members, we're not disclosing that, but suffice to say that it was a great day for both existing Prime members and also new customers who were trying us out for the first time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDarin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd on the stock-based compensation, you'll recall beginning in Q1 this year, we began allocating stock-based com""}","Amazon.com, Inc.'s Q2 2016 earnings call highlighted several quantitative and qualitative elements of their financial performance, centered around revenue growth, operating cash flow, capital expenditures, and forward guidance.

Hello and welcome to our Q2 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and the responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today July 28, 2016, only, and will include forward-looking statements.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on form 10K and subsequent filings.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. Now I will turn the call over to Brian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Darin. I'll begin with comments on our second-quarter financial results.
Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 42% to $12.7 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $4.4 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow, less lease principal repayments, increased to $3.9 billion, up from $2.4 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow, less financed lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases, increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $492 million.
Worldwide revenue increased 31% to $30.4 billion or 30% excluding the $166 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 28%. Worldwide seller units represented 49% of paid units.
Now I will talk about our segment results. North America revenue grew 28% to $17.7 billion. North America operating income was $702 million, a 4% operating margin, compared with $348 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
International revenue grew 30% to $9.8 billion. Excluding the $184 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. International operating loss was $135 million, compared with a loss of $189 million in the prior year. This includes $40 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Amazon Web Services revenue grew 58% to $2.9 billion. Amazon Web Services operating income was $718 million, a 24.9% operating margin, compared with $305 million in the prior year. Our operating income was $1.3 billion, or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year over year. This includes $45 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Net income was $857 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, compared with the net income of $92 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. For Q3 2016, we expect net sales of between $31 billion and $33.5 billion, or growth of between 22% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $50 million and $650 million, compared with $406 million in third quarter 2015.
We are grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks, and with that I will hand it back to Darin.
Thank you, Brian. Before we move to questions I need to remind you that our guidance incorporates the order trend that we've seen to date, and what we believe to be appropriate assumptions.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes that we do not conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.
(Operation Instructions)
Thank you. Our first question is from Mark May of Citi. Please proceed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for taking my question. We've noticed some data points out there that suggest that you're accelerating your build-out of fulfillment capacity in North America and obviously also in India. Can you give us a sense of what sort of impact that, that might have in the near to mid-term on your CapEx, depreciation and ultimately CSOI? Especially as it relates to your Q3 guidance? And then just a maintenance question, how much is FX impacting your Q3 guidance? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thanks, Mark. Yes, let me talk a little bit about guidance, and I'll incorporate the answer to the fulfillment question. So, you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later. But Prime Day was very successful for us. It was up 60% on a worldwide basis over the prior year, and it was also a record day for our Amazon devices, as well as sellers and customers alike.
In the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is a typically a lower operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holiday peak. It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter. To put that in perspective, we launched six in Q3 of last year. This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3, and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first three quarters of last year on a net basis.

Darin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [4]

And, Mark, to follow up on the other question, our net sales guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And, Brian, where does that bring your video content spend to with the doubling in the second half if we look at it on an annualized basis?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're not disclosing that at this time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [7]

Thanks.

Operator    [8]

Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Please state your question.

Douglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to go back to Prime Day for a minute. I didn't hear any commentary around new Prime members in particular. Obviously a lot of other metrics that you gave but hoping you could provide a little bit more color around that.
And then also, is there anything else that stood out in terms of what you learned around operations and systems ahead of the holiday season? And then just going back to the 3Q guide, what's the right way for us to think about stock-based comp in the third quarter and if we looked at your 2Q numbers, is that a fair assumption for what you're thinking about? Thanks.

Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [10]

Sure. Let me circle back on Prime Day. So again, it was the biggest global day ever for Amazon and was up 60% on a order product sales basis versus Prime Day 2015.

Operating income to be between $50 million and $650 million, compared with $406 million in third quarter 2015.\nWe are grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks, and with that I will hand it back to Darin.\nThank you, Brian. Before we move to questions I need to remind you that our guidance incorporates the order trend that we've seen to date, and what we believe to be appropriate assumptions.\nOur results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance also assumes that we do not conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.\nWith that let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.\n\n\n================================================================================\nQuestions and Answers\n================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAt this time, we will now open the call up for questions. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.\n(Operation Instructions)\nThank you. Our first question is from Mark May of Citi. Please proceed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks for taking my question. We've noticed some data points out there that suggest that you're accelerating your build-out of fulfillment capacity in North America and obviously also in India. Can you give us a sense of what sort of impact that, that might have in the near to mid-term on your CapEx, depreciation and ultimately CSOI? Especially as it relates to your Q3 guidance? And then just a maintenance question, how much is FX impacting your Q3 guidance? Thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOkay. Thanks, Mark. Yes, let me talk a little bit about guidance, and I'll incorporate the answer to the fulfillment question. So, you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later. But Prime Day was very successful for us. It was up 60% on a worldwide basis over the prior year, and it was also a record day for our Amazon devices, as well as sellers and customers alike.\nIn the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is a typically a lower operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holiday peak. It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter. To put that in perspective, we launched six in Q3 of last year. This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3, and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first three quarters of last year on a net basis. So, why are we expanding so much? If you remember back to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really strong FBA growth, we talked a lot in the Q4 call about the operational cost of that in Q4. Customers are well taken care of, but we had additional fulfillment costs from being so tight on capacity.\nThis year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we are - Q2 was 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by - units fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA. That compares with last year in Q2 when we saw 22% unit growth. So we're 600 basis points faster growth in Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year turned into 26% in Q4. So it ramped up in the back end of the year.\nSo a lot of data points there, but the bottom line is that there's a large step up in the amount of fulfillment capacity in Q2 - excuse me, Q3 versus Q2. There's a couple of other factors while I'm at it for guidance. We are also nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2015. We have a great slate of new Amazon Originals coming out later this year, both in the US and internationally, and we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon Original shows - TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year. There are other investments, certainly, that are increasing sequentially. I'd point to India and AWS, but primarily the two biggest issues in Q3 guidance I would say are the operational ramp and also the increase in digital content spend.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDarin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd, Mark, to follow up on the other question, our net sales guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd, Brian, where does that bring your video content spend to with the doubling in the second half if we look at it on an annualized basis?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe're not disclosing that at this time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Please state your question.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDouglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks for taking the questions. I just want to go back to Prime Day for a minute. I didn't hear any commentary around new Prime members in particular. Obviously a lot of other metrics that you gave but hoping you could provide a little bit more color around that.\nAnd then also, is there anything else that stood out in terms of what you learned around operations and systems ahead of the holiday season? And then just going back to the 3Q guide, what's the right way for us to think about stock-based comp in the third quarter and if we looked at your 2Q numbers, is that a fair assumption for what you're thinking about? Thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSure. Let me circle back on Prime Day. So again, it was the biggest global day ever for Amazon and was up 60% on a order product sales basis versus Prime Day 2015. It was a record day for Amazon devices. It was a great day for small businesses and sellers who saw great year-over improvement in their sales. And more importantly, it was a great day for customers. Globally they saved over double what they had saved in Prime Day 2015.\nSo we're very pleased with the results of Prime Day, and the impact of Prime Day is factored into this guidance. As far as new customers and new Prime members, we're not disclosing that, but suffice to say that it was a great day for both existing Prime members and also new customers who were trying us out for the first time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDarin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd on the stock-based compensation, you'll recall beginning in Q1 this year, we began allocating stock-based com""}","Amazon.com Inc reported strong financial results for Q2 2016, with key highlights including:

- Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased by 42% to $12.7 billion.
- Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, from $4.4 billion.
- Worldwide revenue increased by 31% to $30.4 billion, or 30% excluding the $166 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
- North America revenue grew by 28% to $17.7 billion, with operating income of $702 million and a 4% operating margin.
- International revenue grew by 30% to $9.8 billion, with an operating loss of $135 million.
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue grew by 58% to $2.9 billion, with an operating income of $718 million and a 24.9% operating margin.
- Net income was $857 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, compared to net income of $92 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.
- For Q3 2016, the company expects net sales between $31 billion and $33.5 billion, representing growth of 22% to 32%. Operating income is expected to be between $50 million and $650 million, compared to $406 million in the third quarter of 2015.

The significant increase in operating cash flow and free cash flow reflects Amazon's strong financial performance and effective management of its cash. The company experienced strong revenue growth in both North America and international markets, and its AWS segment also performed well, with a 58% increase in revenue. Amazon's focus on customer experience and the success of Prime Day contributed to the strong results.

The company has invested heavily in increasing its fulfillment capacity, particularly in Q3, with the opening of 18 new fulfillment centers. This investment is aimed at addressing capacity constraints and accommodating the accelerating growth in unit sales. Amazon also plans to increase its content spend, particularly on Amazon Originals, which will result in an increase in sequential investments.

In terms of guidance, Amazon expects net sales for Q3 to be between $31 billion and $33.5 billion, representing growth of 22% to 32% from the previous year. The company anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $50 million and $650 million, with a focus on preparing for the holiday peak in Q4. However, it is important to note that actual results may differ materially due to various factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and changes in global economic conditions.

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,   -     [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 26, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. I guess I'll just start with, can you give us your thoughts on the Whole Foods integration? How you see that contributing to the bottom line over time? And then on a quick balance sheet note, we obviously saw the strong AWS results, but unearned revenue doesn't seem to be growing at the rate it was in the past. Maybe comment a little bit on the unearned revenue growth on the balance sheet, why it might be slower than the past?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,   -     [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, thanks, Justin. This is Dave. I'd also point you to beyond the balance sheet. There's some disclosure around additions to unearned revenue as part of the cash flow statement. So when you look at that, for the 3 months ended, you'll see that up around 34%, 35% versus the same time last year.
And historically, what we've seen with unearned revenue is big and leading contributor to that is Prime memberships. The example is a customer signing up, paying $99 upfront and having that amortize over the 12 month period. That continues to be the biggest absolute contributor to what you see there. The other one area that's been growing over the past few years is Amazon Web Services, features like reserved instances where those customers can pay for services upfront, in some cases and receive discounts over a multiyear period. What we're seeing and more recently, I think, is on the Prime piece, we launched month-to-month Prime last year, and if you think about how that works, customers are paying $10.99 per month as they go. So there's less that's deferred. So, that's I think one of a number of factors. There's obviously other mix factors going in there besides the pieces that I just mentioned. But we've seen monthly Prime has been a good driver of getting more members into the program. So that's part of what you're seeing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And your question about Whole Foods, yes, we're really excited to have them as part of the team now after the acquisition in late August. What you see in the financial results for this quarter is a -- it's shown actually in the new physical stores, revenue component $1.3 billion of revenue, $21 million of operating income. And that's where you'll be seeing Whole Foods revenue showing up. In addition, that is -- that class of revenue, physical store's revenue is going to be where we are going to book any sales that where a customer physically select an item in a store. So it also -- it does include our Amazon Books. If you step back on Whole Foods, again, I think we've had busy months since we've joined forces, offering lower prices on a range of key grocery items in the stores. Launching the private-label -- Whole Foods private-label products on Amazon, we've got technical work to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program, and we'll have that coming out in the future. We've added Amazon Lockers to select Whole Foods stores. So lots of activity, lots of energy and we're real excited to show customers what's possible when we join forces here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Guess I'll ask 2 as well. The first one is, that was a bit of a usual upside to your guidance, even stripping out Whole Foods. Is there -- what would you -- what's most surprised you in the quarter? You've been pretty consistent to how you reported versus your guide. So something unusual happened or somewhat unusual happen? What would you attribute that to?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. In Q3, yes, I would say we had a very strong Prime Day. As you know, we talked about that on the last call, but it really carried into the quarter. We had a record day for sign-ups for free trials for Prime and Prime Day globally. Had a very strong Prime Day in particular internationally. So it really got a lot more traction in this, the third year that we've had it. So I would point mostly to those factors. There's also very strong quarter for AWS, revenue growth was the same as Q2 and now we're at an $18 billion run rate. Whereas last quarter, when I had this call, we were at $16 billion. So very pleased with the customer response in the AWS business as well. And usage growth is actually growing a lot higher than revenue growth. So particularly pleased with the new customers that we've added and the additional workloads that we've picked up from existing customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And then briefly on the international retail, that growth also by itself was intrinsically stronger than you've seen in a while. Any particular markets geographic markets, you would call out there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, it was pretty strong across the board. We had the impact of Souq, obviously this quarter internationally and the Diwali holiday in India was a few days earlier, which maybe pushed some sales into Q3 versus Q4. But generally, it was the strength of Prime Day internationally and it carried through the quarter. So it's -- but generally, I would point to the increase selection, a lot of the building blocks we've been working on. All the Prime benefits, advancement and free shipping offers or faster shipping offers, the Prime benefits that drive engagement, of course, adding selection, adding Fulfilled by Amazon partners and the selection that they bring. So again, I wouldn't point to anything other than the Prime Day pickup, but stronger than -- it was stronger than probably I anticipated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have 2. Just on Whole Foods again, I was wondering, could you talk about 1 or 2 of the biggest surprises you've seen so far? And then maybe just a strategic opportunity, as you see, of having a brick-and-mortar presence as you look to continue to grow your overall business? And the second one on the subscriptions revenue, you accelerated to 59%, could you just talk about which countries or which regions are driving that? And maybe talk a little bit about the growth or the cadence of what's happening in the U.S., your oldest market?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. On Whole Foods, I would say it is early. August 28 was the close date and -- what I could tell you is, I've been in meetings with John Mackey and his team and they're very like-minded with us, customer-obsessed, ready to work together to continue their mission then expand on their offerings that we can offer customers. The other things I mentioned, price reductions early on, selling products on -- their products on Amazon.com and also installing Amazon Lockers. I think over time, you'll see more cooperation and working together between AmazonFresh, Prime Now and Whole Foods, as we can explore different ways to serve the customer. So that's kind of the earlier report on Whole Foods. So far so good, and we're thrilled to finally be working together after the summer of closing the deal. On subscription revenue, let me just remember your question there. We had essentially 59% growth, you said, 600 basis points higher than Q2. In this line item is certainly the fees associated with Amazon Prime and also it's where a lot of our subscription services from digital music, digital video, audio books, eBooks. So there's some moving parts in there. The growth in Prime has been fairly consistent over the last recent quarters in Prime memberships. And as I said, we had a great -- the largest new Prime -- new sign-ups on Prime Day for the Prime program. The monthly program is gaining traction. It's an attractive option for a lot of people. And again, on this -- on the other subscription services, music especially, it works j

If you step back on Whole Foods, again, I think we've had busy months since we've joined forces, offering lower prices on a range of key grocery items in the stores. Launching the private-label -- Whole Foods private-label products on Amazon, we've got technical work to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program, and we'll have that coming out in the future. We've added Amazon Lockers to select Whole Foods stores. So lots of activity, lots of energy and we're real excited to show customers what's possible when we join forces here.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Guess I'll ask 2 as well. The first one is, that was a bit of a usual upside to your guidance, even stripping out Whole Foods. Is there -- what would you -- what's most surprised you in the quarter? You've been pretty consistent to how you reported versus your guide. So something unusual happened or somewhat unusual happen? What would you attribute that to?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. In Q3, yes, I would say we had a very strong Prime Day. As you know, we talked about that on the last call, but it really carried into the quarter. We had a record day for sign-ups for free trials for Prime and Prime Day globally. Had a very strong Prime Day in particular internationally. So it really got a lot more traction in this, the third year that we've had it. So I would point mostly to those factors. There's also very strong quarter for AWS, revenue growth was the same as Q2 and now we're at an $18 billion run rate. Whereas last quarter, when I had this call, we were at $16 billion. So very pleased with the customer response in the AWS business as well. And usage growth is actually growing a lot higher than revenue growth. So particularly pleased with the new customers that we've added and the additional workloads that we've picked up from existing customers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          And then briefly on the international retail, that growth also by itself was intrinsically stronger than you've seen in a while. Any particular markets geographic markets, you would call out there?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Yes, it was pretty strong across the board. We had the impact of Souq, obviously this quarter internationally and the Diwali holiday in India was a few days earlier, which maybe pushed some sales into Q3 versus Q4. But generally, it was the strength of Prime Day internationally and it carried through the quarter. So it's -- but generally, I would point to the increase selection, a lot of the building blocks we've been working on. All the Prime benefits, advancement and free shipping offers or faster shipping offers, the Prime benefits that drive engagement, of course, adding selection, adding Fulfilled by Amazon partners and the selection that they bring. So again, I wouldn't point to anything other than the Prime Day pickup, but stronger than -- it was stronger than probably I anticipated.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          I have 2. Just on Whole Foods again, I was wondering, could you talk about 1 or 2 of the biggest surprises you've seen so far? And then maybe just a strategic opportunity, as you see, of having a brick-and-mortar presence as you look to continue to grow your overall business? And the second one on the subscriptions revenue, you accelerated to 59%, could you just talk about which countries or which regions are driving that? And maybe talk a little bit about the growth or the cadence of what's happening in the U.S., your oldest market?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [12]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. On Whole Foods, I would say it is early. August 28 was the close date and -- what I could tell you is, I've been in meetings with John Mackey and his team and they're very like-minded with us, customer-obsessed, ready to work together to continue their mission then expand on their offerings that we can offer customers. The other things I mentioned, price reductions early on, selling products on -- their products on Amazon.com and also installing Amazon Lockers. I think over time, you'll see more cooperation and working together between AmazonFresh, Prime Now and Whole Foods, as we can explore different ways to serve the customer. So that's kind of the earlier report on Whole Foods. So far so good, and we're thrilled to finally be working together after the summer of closing the deal. On subscription revenue, let me just remember your question there. We had essentially 59% growth, you said, 600 basis points higher than Q2. In this line item is certainly the fees associated with Amazon Prime and also it's where a lot of our subscription services from digital music, digital video, audio books, eBooks. So there's some moving parts in there. The growth in Prime has been fairly consistent over the last recent quarters in Prime memberships. And as I said, we had a great -- the largest new Prime -- new sign-ups on Prime Day for the Prime program. The monthly program is gaining traction. It's an attractive option for a lot of people. And again, on this -- on the other subscription services, music especially, it works j""}","In Amazon's Q3 2017 earnings call, several pertinent details regarding the company's financial performance and expectations were discussed. Here's a synthesis of the key insights:

1. **Revenue Contributions and Growth Drivers:**
   - Whole Foods, acquired in late August, contributed $1.3 billion to revenue and $21 million to operating income, noted under the new ""physical store's revenue"" category.  
   - The Prime Day event led to record sign-ups and significant international growth, impacting revenue positively.
   - AWS continued to show strong performance with a revenue growth rate consistent with the previous quarter, now pushing $18 billion run rate, up from $16 billion.
   - International retail growth was reported as strong across various geographic markets, attributed partly to Souq acquisition and an earlier Diwali in India, implying potential seasonality effects. 

2. **Membership and Subscription Services:**
   - The 59% acceleration in subscription revenue includes Prime fees, and digital services in music, video, and ebooks.
   - Growth in Prime has been consistent, with traction gained in the monthly Prime program offering.

3. **Whole Foods Integration and Strategy:**
   - Whole Foods has seen early price reductions, with private label products being launched on Amazon.com, and Amazon Lockers installed in select stores.
   - Future strategies to integrate AmazonFresh, Prime Now with Whole Foods were hinted at but not detailed.

4. **Unearned Revenue Dynamics:**
   - The growth in the unearned revenue segment on the balance sheet slowed due to the introduction of month-to-month Prime memberships that amortize revenue monthly, rather than the annual upfront payment.

5. **CFO Comments on Financial Expectations:**
   - Brian Olsavsky remarked on the unpredictability of results, influenced by factors including foreign exchange rates, global economic conditions, customer spending, the pace of internet and cloud services growth among others. 
   - Forward guidance assumes there are no business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements not already concluded.

6. **Capital and Expenses:**
   - Details on capital expenditure or operating expenses were not explicitly mentioned within the provided text excerpt.
   - There was no explicit mention of EBITDA, capital structure, future capital transactions, debt, free cash flow, hedges, liquidity, or margins in the given transcript section.

While discussing the company's guidance, the management maintained an emphasis on the inherent unpredictability of their financial results, underscoring various influencing factors, and the stipulation that the guidance did not account for any future business activities not already made public.",gpt-4

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,   -     [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 26, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. I guess I'll just start with, can you give us your thoughts on the Whole Foods integration? How you see that contributing to the bottom line over time? And then on a quick balance sheet note, we obviously saw the strong AWS results, but unearned revenue doesn't seem to be growing at the rate it was in the past. Maybe comment a little bit on the unearned revenue growth on the balance sheet, why it might be slower than the past?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,   -     [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, thanks, Justin. This is Dave. I'd also point you to beyond the balance sheet. There's some disclosure around additions to unearned revenue as part of the cash flow statement. So when you look at that, for the 3 months ended, you'll see that up around 34%, 35% versus the same time last year.
And historically, what we've seen with unearned revenue is big and leading contributor to that is Prime memberships. The example is a customer signing up, paying $99 upfront and having that amortize over the 12 month period. That continues to be the biggest absolute contributor to what you see there. The other one area that's been growing over the past few years is Amazon Web Services, features like reserved instances where those customers can pay for services upfront, in some cases and receive discounts over a multiyear period. What we're seeing and more recently, I think, is on the Prime piece, we launched month-to-month Prime last year, and if you think about how that works, customers are paying $10.99 per month as they go. So there's less that's deferred. So, that's I think one of a number of factors. There's obviously other mix factors going in there besides the pieces that I just mentioned. But we've seen monthly Prime has been a good driver of getting more members into the program. So that's part of what you're seeing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And your question about Whole Foods, yes, we're really excited to have them as part of the team now after the acquisition in late August. What you see in the financial results for this quarter is a -- it's shown actually in the new physical stores, revenue component $1.3 billion of revenue, $21 million of operating income. And that's where you'll be seeing Whole Foods revenue showing up. In addition, that is -- that class of revenue, physical store's revenue is going to be where we are going to book any sales that where a customer physically select an item in a store. So it also -- it does include our Amazon Books. If you step back on Whole Foods, again, I think we've had busy months since we've joined forces, offering lower prices on a range of key grocery items in the stores. Launching the private-label -- Whole Foods private-label products on Amazon, we've got technical work to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program, and we'll have that coming out in the future. We've added Amazon Lockers to select Whole Foods stores. So lots of activity, lots of energy and we're real excited to show customers what's possible when we join forces here.

          Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Guess I'll ask 2 as well. The first one is, that was a bit of a usual upside to your guidance, even stripping out Whole Foods. Is there -- what would you -- what's most surprised you in the quarter? You've been pretty consistent to how you reported versus your guide. So something unusual happened or somewhat unusual happen? What would you attribute that to?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. In Q3, yes, I would say we had a very strong Prime Day. As you know, we talked about that on the last call, but it really carried into the quarter. We had a record day for sign-ups for free trials for Prime and Prime Day globally. Had a very strong Prime Day in particular internationally. So it really got a lot more traction in this, the third year that we've had it. So I would point mostly to those factors.

So particularly pleased with the new customers that we've added and the additional workloads that we've picked up from existing customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And then briefly on the international retail, that growth also by itself was intrinsically stronger than you've seen in a while. Any particular markets geographic markets, you would call out there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, it was pretty strong across the board. We had the impact of Souq, obviously this quarter internationally and the Diwali holiday in India was a few days earlier, which maybe pushed some sales into Q3 versus Q4. But generally, it was the strength of Prime Day internationally and it carried through the quarter.

          Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have 2. Just on Whole Foods again, I was wondering, could you talk about 1 or 2 of the biggest surprises you've seen so far? And then maybe just a strategic opportunity, as you see, of having a brick-and-mortar presence as you look to continue to grow your overall business?

There's also very strong quarter for AWS, revenue growth was the same as Q2 and now we're at an $18 billion run rate. Whereas last quarter, when I had this call, we were at $16 billion. So very pleased with the customer response in the AWS business as well. And usage growth is actually growing a lot higher than revenue growth. So particularly pleased with the new customers that we've added and the additional workloads that we've picked up from existing customers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          And then briefly on the international retail, that growth also by itself was intrinsically stronger than you've seen in a while. Any particular markets geographic markets, you would call out there?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Yes, it was pretty strong across the board. We had the impact of Souq, obviously this quarter internationally and the Diwali holiday in India was a few days earlier, which maybe pushed some sales into Q3 versus Q4. But generally, it was the strength of Prime Day internationally and it carried through the quarter. So it's -- but generally, I would point to the increase selection, a lot of the building blocks we've been working on. All the Prime benefits, advancement and free shipping offers or faster shipping offers, the Prime benefits that drive engagement, of course, adding selection, adding Fulfilled by Amazon partners and the selection that they bring. So again, I wouldn't point to anything other than the Prime Day pickup, but stronger than -- it was stronger than probably I anticipated.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          I have 2. Just on Whole Foods again, I was wondering, could you talk about 1 or 2 of the biggest surprises you've seen so far? And then maybe just a strategic opportunity, as you see, of having a brick-and-mortar presence as you look to continue to grow your overall business? And the second one on the subscriptions revenue, you accelerated to 59%, could you just talk about which countries or which regions are driving that? And maybe talk a little bit about the growth or the cadence of what's happening in the U.S., your oldest market?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [12]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Sure. On Whole Foods, I would say it is early. August 28 was the close date and -- what I could tell you is, I've been in meetings with John Mackey and his team and they're very like-minded with us, customer-obsessed, ready to work together to continue their mission then expand on their offerings that we can offer customers. The other things I mentioned, price reductions early on, selling products on -- their products on Amazon.com and also installing Amazon Lockers. I think over time, you'll see more cooperation and working together between AmazonFresh, Prime Now and Whole Foods, as we can explore different ways to serve the customer. So that's kind of the earlier report on Whole Foods. So far so good, and we're thrilled to finally be working together after the summer of closing the deal. On subscription revenue, let me just remember your question there. We had essentially 59% growth, you said, 600 basis points higher than Q2. In this line item is certainly the fees associated with Amazon Prime and also it's where a lot of our subscription services from digital music, digital video, audio books, eBooks. So there's some moving parts in there. The growth in Prime has been fairly consistent over the last recent quarters in Prime memberships. And as I said, we had a great -- the largest new Prime -- new sign-ups on Prime Day for the Prime program. The monthly program is gaining traction. It's an attractive option for a lot of people. And again, on this -- on the other subscription services, music especially, it works j""}","Key Insights from the Earnings Call Transcript:

The quarter saw a revenue of $61.1 billion, representing a 16% increase year over year. This growth marks the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue for the company. Net income was reported at $13.8 billion, and the diluted EPS was an impressive $2.73. Apple‚Äôs broad-based performance included notable increases across product categories, such as a 14% revenue boost from iPhone sales, a substantial 31% upturn from services, and almost a 50% surge in wearables.

The geographic revenue growth was also impressive, with noteworthy mentions of over a 20% rise in revenue from Greater China and Japan. Within the first half of the fiscal year, the company amassed $100 billion in iPhone revenue ‚Äî a $12 billion elevation from the previous year and the highest growth rate in three years. iPhone‚Äôs global market share also expanded according to IDC's latest estimates, with customers gravitating towards the iPhone X, consistently choosing it over other models since its launch.

Services, comprising the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple Pay, had also notably crossed the $9 billion mark for the first time. Significantly, paid subscriptions across all services surpassed 270 million, a jump of over 100 million from the previous year, contributing to this increase in services revenue. Apple Pay, in particular, exhibited robust growth with active users doubling and transactions tripling year over year. Its reach expanded with the addition of new markets, including its recent launch in Brazil.

The wearables sector, encompassing the Apple Watch, Beats, and AirPods, had an exceptional quarter with combined revenue growth of nearly 50% year over year. The Apple Watch continued to achieve high sales, contributing to Apple‚Äôs claim of it being the top-selling watch in the world. The HomePod, having started shipping in February, was applauded for its audio quality, and there are plans to enhance the product and introduce it to more markets globally.

From an educational standpoint, Apple updated its most popular iPad and launched the Everyone Can Create initiative alongside its successful Everyone Can Code program. iOS 11.3, a significant update, brought augmented reality experiences and a feature to view consolidated personal health records.

The company‚Äôs commitment to the environment was underscored by its milestone of operating all its global facilities on 100% clean energy. Driving its supply chain toward using clean energy, 23 of its suppliers have committed to 100% renewable energy.

Financially, the consistent double-digit growth has produced nearly $150 billion in revenue, with the company exhibiting optimism about its future, boasting what they describe as the best pipeline of products and services to date. Apple also highlights its strong balance sheet and cash flow generation abilities, which enable significant investment in their product roadmap while returning capital to shareholders.

Following the recent corporate tax reform, Apple can now more efficiently deploy its global cash through share repurchases and dividend payments. As a result, a new $100 billion share repurchase authorization has been approved, alongside a 16% increase in the quarterly dividend.

The financial specifics disclosed in the call, including the gross margin of 38.3%, cash plus marketable securities at $267.2 billion, net cash of $145 billion, term debt of $110 billion, and share repurchase of 137 million shares for $23.5 billion, reflect the company‚Äôs robust capital structure.

For the upcoming quarter, Apple forecasts revenue between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion, implying a strategic anticipation of business dynamics. This guidance is informed by the company's strong historical performance and future potential, as they continue to expand their global footprint and innovate across product lines.",gpt-4

Despite a predicted foreign exchange drag of almost $1 billion, the company's revenue exceeded expectations. Apple set new quarterly revenue records in the Americas and the Rest of Asia Pacific, and saw improving revenue trends in Greater China.

The iPhone segment, which generated $33 billion in revenue, showed a significant improvement in performance. The 9% year-over-year decline was a major improvement over the 15% decline seen in the first three quarters of the year. This upswing in demand was reflected in positive reviews, customer feedback, and in-store response to the new iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models. The iPhone 11 became Apple's best-selling iPhone since its launch. The new models feature advanced performance, improved camera systems, and new features such as Night mode and extended dynamic range for video.

Aside from the iPhone, Apple experienced growth in other segments. Revenue outside of the iPhone increased by 17%. The Services segment generated $12.5 billion in revenue, up 18% year over year.

Apple also launched Apple Arcade, a game subscription service, and expanded the reach of Apple News+ to Australia and the UK. In addition, Apple will be launching Apple TV+ in over 100 countries and regions. Overall, Apple's services business continued to show strong growth.

The Wearables segment also had a remarkable performance, with record revenues in all markets globally. The Apple Watch Series 5, with its new features and health tracking capabilities, was well received. Apple deepened its commitment to medical research and announced collaborations with leading health institutions for various studies. The iPad segment generated 17% growth, driven by the iPad Pro and the release of the seventh-generation iPad. The Mac business generated $7 billion in revenue, which was the highest annual revenue ever for Apple.

In terms of geographical performance, Apple achieved new revenue records in multiple countries, including the US, Canada, Germany, France, and Korea. The company believes that its commitment to innovation and values has contributed to its success across markets. Apple continues to focus on user privacy and its environmental initiatives, such as running on 100% renewable energy and using recycled materials in its products.

Looking ahead, Apple provided revenue guidance for Q1 2020, expecting revenues to be between $85.5 billion and $89.5 billion. This guidance reflects Apple's confidence in the upcoming holiday season and the anticipated demand for its products and services. The company is focused on driving further growth in its services business and expanding its reach in international markets.",gpt-3

- The company expressed a commitment to investing during economic uncertainty, seeing such periods as opportunities to develop breakthrough products and enter new markets.
- The balance sheet remains strong with nearly $216 billion in cash reserves, equating to approximately $39 per share of Apple stock.

Apple's financial position is strong, with nearly $216 billion in cash, allowing for investments in new markets and the rapid return of capital to shareholders.

The financials for Q1 2016 showed revenue growth of 2% year-over-year, driven by record iPhone sales, record revenue from services, expanded availability of Apple Watch, and the successful launch of the new Apple TV. Despite the negative impact of foreign currency weakness, revenue growth rate reached 8% in constant currency. Apple sold 5.3 million Macs and 16.1 million iPads in the quarter. The company's enterprise initiatives expanded, with partnerships with IBM and Cisco gaining momentum.

The services segment performed well, with revenue of nearly $6.1 billion. Services tied to Apple's installed base are quite profitable, and the company recognizes revenue based on transaction value. Apple's active installed base recently exceeded 1 billion devices, providing a strong foundation for future business growth.

Overall, Apple's Q1 2016 earnings call revealed strong financial performance, despite global economic challenges. The company's focus on the Chinese market, innovation across its product portfolio, and the growth of its services segment contribute to its continued success.",gpt-3

""}","Apple Inc.'s Q3 2017 earnings call revealed robust financial growth marked by a 7% year-over-year increase in revenue, reaching $45.4 billion, and net income of $8.7 billion. The company's diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $1.67, representing a notable 17% climb compared to the previous year. Furthermore, Apple's gross margin (GM) was reported at 38.5%, positioning at the higher end of their guidance.

In terms of product performance, Apple observed growth across all categories. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models drove significant revenue, with the 7 Plus experiencing a substantial boost in sales compared to the previous year's 6s Plus. The successful introduction of the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, with advanced display technology and performance surpassing most PC desktops, was particularly impactful in the education sector. Educational sales of iPads in the US soared by 32% year-over-year.

The Services segment achieved an all-time quarterly record with $7.3 billion in revenue, increasing by 22% year-over-year, with the App Store being a substantial driver. Apple's Services business has now reached the size of a Fortune 100 company. Moreover, paid subscriptions across all services exceeded 185 million, a near 20 million increment within 90 days.

Apple also highlighted strong performance in the wearables segment, with over 50% growth in Apple Watch sales and high customer satisfaction for the new AirPods, despite a struggle to meet the overwhelming demand.

From a broader perspective, Apple's capital allocation strategy included the return of $4.5 billion to investors through share repurchases, buying back 30.4 million AAPL shares. Additionally, the company ended the quarter with a staggering cash plus marketable securities reserve of $261.5 billion.

Applying a forward-looking lens, Apple projected a Q4 2017 revenue estimate between $49 billion and $52 billion. The rationale behind this guidance accounts for the anticipation of new product launches and seasonality effects, such as the back-to-school period which typically bolsters sales.

Addressing the macroeconomic landscape, Apple acknowledged a 200 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange year-over-year, influenced primarily by currency fluctuations in Europe and China. Despite these headwinds, the company managed to deliver growth in all geographic segments and saw double-digit advances in several developed and emerging markets.

Finally, Apple's continued innovation and ecosystem expansion were evidenced by the investment in advanced manufacturing in the US, earmarking at least $1 billion towards this initiative, along with advancements in software with iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra set for release in the fall.

The call stopped short of providing insights into areas such as cost savings, EBITDA, future capital transactions, debt levels, liquidity, or detailed operating expenses, and hence, these variables have been excluded from the narrative.",gpt-4

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apple, Incorporated second-quarter FY16 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. 
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, growth margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future business outlook, and plans for capital return and debt issuance. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. 
For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apples Form 10-K for 2015, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of FY16, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the Associated Press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective date. 
In addition, today's comments will refer to a metric we describe as the purchase value of services tied to our installed base. This is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our investor relations website at Apple.com/investor. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Nancy, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we're reporting the results of a very busy and challenging quarter, and we're also announcing an update to our capital return program. 
Revenue for the quarter was $50.6 billion, which was within our guidance range. Despite the pause in our growth, our results reflect excellent execution by our team in the face of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in much of the world, and difficult year-over-year comparisons. 
We saw continued currency weakness in the vast majority of our international markets. In constant currency, our revenue declined by 9% from last year, 400 basis points less than the reported decline of 13%. For the first half of the fiscal year, our revenue in constant currency was up 1% year-on-year. 
Despite challenges, there were a number of encouraging signs during the quarter. Our installed base of over 1 billion active devices continued to grow strongly. We added a huge number of Android switchers and new-to-Mac customers, and we generated very strong growth from services. 
We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, consistent with the range of our own expectations, but lower than the exceptional year-ago quarter, when we saw an acceleration in iPhone upgrades, and 40% iPhone sales growth over the previous year. To provide some additional color, iPhone sales come from three sources: Customers who upgrade from previous iPhone models, customers who switch from Android and other operating systems, and customers who purchase a smart phone for the first time. 
As we look at each of these three sources of iPhone sales, we see a business that is healthy and strong. First, from an upgrade perspective, during the first half of this year, the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle has been slightly higher than what we experienced in the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago, but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate we saw with iPhone 6, which as you know, was a big contributor to our phenomenal revenue growth a year ago. Most importantly, our customers are incredibly loyal. A recent Kantar survey of US smart phone purchasers indicated a 95% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured for any smart phone. 
Second, we continued to see a very high level of customers switching to iPhone from Android and other operating systems. In fact, we added more switchers from Android and other platforms in the first half of this year than any other six-month period ever. 
And third, with only 42% smart phone penetration of the global handset market today, iPhone is still attracting millions of first-time smart phone buyers each quarter, especially from emerging markets. For example, in India, our iPhone sales were up 56% from a year ago. 
Next, I'd like to talk about services, which was our second-largest revenue generating category during the quarter. Setting aside the amount we received from a patent settlement in the December quarter, the March quarter services revenue was our highest ever. Services revenue jumped 20% to $6 billion. App Store revenue was up 35% to beat last quarter's all-time record, and Apple Music continues to grow in popularity with over 13 million paying subscribers today. We feel really great about the early success of Apple's first subscription business, and our Music revenue has now hit an inflection point after many quarters of decline. 
The services business is powered by our huge installed base of active device, which crossed 1 billion units earlier this year. As we discussed on this call in January, those 1 billion-plus active devices are a source of recurring revenue that is growing independent of the unit shipments we report every three months. In fact, the purchase value of services tied to our installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the March quarter, up 27% over last year, accelerating from the 24% growth rate we reported in the December quarter. 
The reach of Apple Pay also continues to expand, following a very successful launch in China in the March quarter, and last week's roll-out in Singapore. Apple Pay is growing at a tremendous rate, with more than 5 times the transaction volume of a year ago, and 1 million new users per week. There are more than 10 million contactless ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay has launched today, including over 2.5 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States, and more expansion of Apple Pay is coming soon. 
Turning to the Mac, we met our sell-in expectations, in addition to reducing channel inventory by about 100,000 unites. Overall, the Mac continues to attract  a large percentage of new customers. In our latest survey of major markets, over half of buyers were new to the Mac, and in some countries, the percentage is extremely high, like in China, where over 80% of customers were purchasing a Mac for the first time. We're confident in our Mac business, and our ability to continue to innovate and gain share in that area. 
Turning to the Apple Watch, unit sales met our expectations in the quarter. For some color on how we think about Apple Watch sales, we expected seasonality to be similar to the historical seasonality of iPod, which typically generated 40% or more of its annual unit sell-through in the December  quarter. 
We started shipping Apple  Watch just one year ago, and it has quickly become the best-selling and most loved smart watch in the world. In fact, unit sales of Apple Watch during its first year exceeded sales of iPhone in its first year. Last month, we refreshed the lineup for the spring with new bands and a new starting price point, and the response from customers has been great. 
Apple Watch is an increasingly essential part of user's lives, from responding to messages, managing calendars and navigating with maps, to helping them  be more fit. And in some cases, the heart rate sensor has even helped save lives. We're really excited about the first year with Apple Watch. We have learned a lot, and we believe it has an exciting future ahead. 
We announced some fantastic new products during the March quarter. iPhone SE became available on March 31, so none of its sales were reflected in our second-quarter results, but so far this quarter, we're seeing terrific customer response. iPhone SE is the most powerful four-inch phone ever, and it's a great option for customers all over the world who want a compact phone with advanced features, and a great price, without compromising performance. Demand has been very strong, and exceeds supply at this point, but we're working hard to get the iPhone SE into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible. The addition of the iPhone SE in the iPhone lineup places us in a better strategic position to attract even more customers into our ecosystem. 
We also unveiled the stunning 9.7 inch iPad Pro, with cutting-edge performance and our most advanced display yet. The reviews of our new iPad Pros have been great, and we are hearing from customers of the features and capabilities in the new Pros make them both the ultimate upgrade for iPad owners, and a great PC replacement. 
In the June quarter, we expect to see our best iPad revenue compare in over two years. iPad is the best-selling, best-reviewed and  most used tablet on the market. Customers tell us that they love iPad for its unique mix of portability, capability, and versatility, with over 1 million iPad apps in the App Store to help them work, play, learn, and create. 
We also announced Care Kit, a new software framework that developers can use to help people take a more active role in their health, by keeping track of their care plans, monitoring their symptoms and medication, and delivering the insights they need to make smart decisions about their health. We're very excited about the ways iPhone and Apple Watch are helping people lead healthier lives. We believe there's great promise here for the future, and we are very interested in where this can take us. 
As always, we are contributing to society beyond our products, promoting the use of renewable energy across our facilities and inside our supply chain, and developing cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize recycling in the materials we use. We are unwavering in our commitment to protect the security and privacy of our customers and their data, and we are actively promoting inclusion and equality across our business. 
As we continue through the June quarter, I'd like to remind you that we measure the health of customer demand based on sell-through. Despite ending Q2 within our channel inventory targets, in light of the macroeconomic environment we plan to lower our channel inventories in the June quarter. This will impact our reported revenue in Q3. Luca will provide more details on this in his commentary. 
But before turning over the call to him, I will summarize by saying that the future of Apple is very bright. Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store. We are very excited about bringing together developers for our four major platforms at our worldwide developers conference in June. 
We are forging ahead with important investments in research and development, in our infrastructure, and in our supply chain. We've made 15 acquisitions in the last four quarters to accelerate our product and services roadmaps, and we are always on the lookout for companies with great technology, talent, and strategic fit. 
Creating value for shareholders by developing great products and services that enrich people's lives will always be our top priority, and the key factor driving our investments and capital allocation decisions. As our business continues to generate high levels of free cash flow, we are in the fortunate position to expand our capital return program again this year, as we have done each year since we started the program four years ago. 
Today, we are announcing an extension of the timeframe of the program by four quarters through March of 2018, and we are expanding the total program size from $200 billion to $250 billion. Luca has more details on this announcement and our results for the March quarter. Luca?

Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with the March quarter results. Revenue for the quarter landed within our guidance range at $50.6 billion, compared to $58 billion in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 13%. 
As we had expected, our comparisons to last year were influenced by the continued strength of the US dollar against foreign currencies. That being said, in constant currency, our revenue declined by 9%. On a geographic basis, in Asia, our revenue grew strongly in Japan, but it declined in greater China and the rest of Asia-Pacific. 
However our business in these two regions is faring better than the numbers might suggest. We had significant channel inventory reductions and currency weakness, which affected our reported revenue for both of these segments. In mainland China, revenue was down 11%, and the decline was 7% in constant currency terms. Keep in mind that we were up against an extremely difficult year-ago compare, when our mainland China revenue grew 81%. We remain very optimistic about the China market over the long-term, and we are committed to investing there for the long run. 
Gross margin was 39.4%, near the high-end of our guidance range, thanks to strong cost performance. Operating margin was

In fact, we added more switchers from Android and other platforms in the first half of this year than any other six-month period ever. \nAnd third, with only 42% smart phone penetration of the global handset market today, iPhone is still attracting millions of first-time smart phone buyers each quarter, especially from emerging markets. For example, in India, our iPhone sales were up 56% from a year ago. \nNext, I'd like to talk about services, which was our second-largest revenue generating category during the quarter. Setting aside the amount we received from a patent settlement in the December quarter, the March quarter services revenue was our highest ever. Services revenue jumped 20% to $6 billion. App Store revenue was up 35% to beat last quarter's all-time record, and Apple Music continues to grow in popularity with over 13 million paying subscribers today. We feel really great about the early success of Apple's first subscription business, and our Music revenue has now hit an inflection point after many quarters of decline. \nThe services business is powered by our huge installed base of active device, which crossed 1 billion units earlier this year. As we discussed on this call in January, those 1 billion-plus active devices are a source of recurring revenue that is growing independent of the unit shipments we report every three months. In fact, the purchase value of services tied to our installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the March quarter, up 27% over last year, accelerating from the 24% growth rate we reported in the December quarter. \nThe reach of Apple Pay also continues to expand, following a very successful launch in China in the March quarter, and last week's roll-out in Singapore. Apple Pay is growing at a tremendous rate, with more than 5 times the transaction volume of a year ago, and 1 million new users per week. There are more than 10 million contactless ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay has launched today, including over 2.5 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States, and more expansion of Apple Pay is coming soon. \nTurning to the Mac, we met our sell-in expectations, in addition to reducing channel inventory by about 100,000 unites. Overall, the Mac continues to attract  a large percentage of new customers. In our latest survey of major markets, over half of buyers were new to the Mac, and in some countries, the percentage is extremely high, like in China, where over 80% of customers were purchasing a Mac for the first time. We're confident in our Mac business, and our ability to continue to innovate and gain share in that area. \nTurning to the Apple Watch, unit sales met our expectations in the quarter. For some color on how we think about Apple Watch sales, we expected seasonality to be similar to the historical seasonality of iPod, which typically generated 40% or more of its annual unit sell-through in the December  quarter. \nWe started shipping Apple  Watch just one year ago, and it has quickly become the best-selling and most loved smart watch in the world. In fact, unit sales of Apple Watch during its first year exceeded sales of iPhone in its first year. Last month, we refreshed the lineup for the spring with new bands and a new starting price point, and the response from customers has been great. \nApple Watch is an increasingly essential part of user's lives, from responding to messages, managing calendars and navigating with maps, to helping them  be more fit. And in some cases, the heart rate sensor has even helped save lives. We're really excited about the first year with Apple Watch. We have learned a lot, and we believe it has an exciting future ahead. \nWe announced some fantastic new products during the March quarter. iPhone SE became available on March 31, so none of its sales were reflected in our second-quarter results, but so far this quarter, we're seeing terrific customer response. iPhone SE is the most powerful four-inch phone ever, and it's a great option for customers all over the world who want a compact phone with advanced features, and a great price, without compromising performance. Demand has been very strong, and exceeds supply at this point, but we're working hard to get the iPhone SE into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible. The addition of the iPhone SE in the iPhone lineup places us in a better strategic position to attract even more customers into our ecosystem. \nWe also unveiled the stunning 9.7 inch iPad Pro, with cutting-edge performance and our most advanced display yet. The reviews of our new iPad Pros have been great, and we are hearing from customers of the features and capabilities in the new Pros make them both the ultimate upgrade for iPad owners, and a great PC replacement. \nIn the June quarter, we expect to see our best iPad revenue compare in over two years. iPad is the best-selling, best-reviewed and  most used tablet on the market. Customers tell us that they love iPad for its unique mix of portability, capability, and versatility, with over 1 million iPad apps in the App Store to help them work, play, learn, and create. \nWe also announced Care Kit, a new software framework that developers can use to help people take a more active role in their health, by keeping track of their care plans, monitoring their symptoms and medication, and delivering the insights they need to make smart decisions about their health. We're very excited about the ways iPhone and Apple Watch are helping people lead healthier lives. We believe there's great promise here for the future, and we are very interested in where this can take us. \nAs always, we are contributing to society beyond our products, promoting the use of renewable energy across our facilities and inside our supply chain, and developing cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize recycling in the materials we use. We are unwavering in our commitment to protect the security and privacy of our customers and their data, and we are actively promoting inclusion and equality across our business. \nAs we continue through the June quarter, I'd like to remind you that we measure the health of customer demand based on sell-through. Despite ending Q2 within our channel inventory targets, in light of the macroeconomic environment we plan to lower our channel inventories in the June quarter. This will impact our reported revenue in Q3. Luca will provide more details on this in his commentary. \nBut before turning over the call to him, I will summarize by saying that the future of Apple is very bright. Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store. We are very excited about bringing together developers for our four major platforms at our worldwide developers conference in June. \nWe are forging ahead with important investments in research and development, in our infrastructure, and in our supply chain. We've made 15 acquisitions in the last four quarters to accelerate our product and services roadmaps, and we are always on the lookout for companies with great technology, talent, and strategic fit. \nCreating value for shareholders by developing great products and services that enrich people's lives will always be our top priority, and the key factor driving our investments and capital allocation decisions. As our business continues to generate high levels of free cash flow, we are in the fortunate position to expand our capital return program again this year, as we have done each year since we started the program four years ago. \nToday, we are announcing an extension of the timeframe of the program by four quarters through March of 2018, and we are expanding the total program size from $200 billion to $250 billion. Luca has more details on this announcement and our results for the March quarter. Luca? \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLuca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with the March quarter results. Revenue for the quarter landed within our guidance range at $50.6 billion, compared to $58 billion in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 13%. \nAs we had expected, our comparisons to last year were influenced by the continued strength of the US dollar against foreign currencies. That being said, in constant currency, our revenue declined by 9%. On a geographic basis, in Asia, our revenue grew strongly in Japan, but it declined in greater China and the rest of Asia-Pacific. \nHowever our business in these two regions is faring better than the numbers might suggest. We had significant channel inventory reductions and currency weakness, which affected our reported revenue for both of these segments. In mainland China, revenue was down 11%, and the decline was 7% in constant currency terms. Keep in mind that we were up against an extremely difficult year-ago compare, when our mainland China revenue grew 81%. We remain very optimistic about the China market over the long-term, and we are committed to investing there for the long run. \nGross margin was 39.4%, near the high-end of our guidance range, thanks to strong cost performance. Operating margin was ""}","Apple Inc.'s Q2 2016 Earnings Call, held on April 26, 2016, detailed a variety of performance metrics and insights into the company's strategy, financials, and market dynamics. Several key points emerged from the call:

1. **Revenue and Sales Performance:**
   - Apple reported a quarterly revenue of $50.6 billion, a 13% decline year-over-year, within the guidance range provided.
   - Currency fluctuations impacted foreign markets, with revenue declining 9% in constant currency terms.
   - There was a year-over-year decline in Greater China, with an 11% reported revenue decline (7% in constant currency), against a tough comparison with an 81% growth in the previous year.
   - Significant channel inventory reductions were noted, affecting reported revenue figures for the Asia-Pacific region.

2. **Product and Market Segments:**
   - iPhone sales reached 51.2 million units, reflecting a downturn from the previous year but consistent with Apple‚Äôs expectations.
   - The installed base of over 1 billion active devices signaled strong ecosystem growth.
   - Services emerged as a robust revenue stream, with a 20% jump to $6 billion in the quarter, led by 35% growth in App Store revenue.
   - Apple Pay exhibited significant growth with a fivefold increase in transaction volume year-over-year.
   - The Mac product line met sales expectations and drew a large percentage of new customers.
   - Apple Watch sales aligned with expectations and outpaced iPhone‚Äôs first-year sales.
   - iPad Pro's 9.7-inch model, along with the iPhone SE release, was expected to fuel the upcoming quarter‚Äôs revenues.

3. **Financial Health and Capital Structure:**
   - Gross margin reached 39.4%, near the high end of the guidance range, attributed to strong cost performance.
   - The company‚Äôs capital return program was expanded from $200 billion to $250 billion, with an extension through March 2018.
   - Apple's free cash flow generation remained robust, allowing for continued investments and capital returns to shareholders.

4. **Strategic Investments and Outlook:**
   - Apple planned to reduce channel inventory in the June quarter in response to the macroeconomic environment, anticipated to impact reported revenue in Q3.
   - The company underscored its focus on long-term investments in China.
   - Research and development, infrastructure, and supply chain investments were key priorities.
   - There was an active pursuit of acquisitions to enhance product and services pathways, with 15 acquisitions in the last four quarters.

5. **Guidance Rationale:**
   - Sell-through was used to gauge the health of customer demand, not solely relying on reported revenue.
   - Apple anticipated seasonality to affect some product categories, similar to historical patterns seen with iPod sales.

The overall narrative focused on navigating through macroeconomic headwinds, leveraging a strong ecosystem of services and products, maintaining customer loyalty, and managing the capital structure efficiently to return value to shareholders while investing for the future. Detailed financial metrics like gross margin percentage and service growth rates enriched the color and context of Apple's performance. While revenue had declined, there were clear indicators of strategic positioning for future growth, and the company was upfront about the various factors affecting its performance, including global economic conditions and currency fluctuations.",gpt-4

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apple, Incorporated second-quarter FY16 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. 
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, growth margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future business outlook, and plans for capital return and debt issuance. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. 
For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apples Form 10-K for 2015, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of FY16, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the Associated Press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective date. 
In addition, today's comments will refer to a metric we describe as the purchase value of services tied to our installed base. This is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our investor relations website at Apple.com/investor. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.

Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Nancy, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we're reporting the results of a very busy and challenging quarter, and we're also announcing an update to our capital return program. 
Revenue for the quarter was $50.6 billion, which was within our guidance range. Despite the pause in our growth, our results reflect excellent execution by our team in the face of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in much of the world, and difficult year-over-year comparisons. 
We saw continued currency weakness in the vast majority of our international markets. In constant currency, our revenue declined by 9% from last year, 400 basis points less than the reported decline of 13%. For the first half of the fiscal year, our revenue in constant currency was up 1% year-on-year. 
Despite challenges, there were a number of encouraging signs during the quarter. Our installed base of over 1 billion active devices continued to grow strongly. We added a huge number of Android switchers and new-to-Mac customers, and we generated very strong growth from services. 
We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, consistent with the range of our own expectations, but lower than the exceptional year-ago quarter, when we saw an acceleration in iPhone upgrades, and 40% iPhone sales growth over the previous year. To provide some additional color, iPhone sales come from three sources: Customers who upgrade from previous iPhone models, customers who switch from Android and other operating systems, and customers who purchase a smart phone for the first time. 
As we look at each of these three sources of iPhone sales, we see a business that is healthy and strong. First, from an upgrade perspective, during the first half of this year, the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle has been slightly higher than what we experienced in the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago, but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate we saw with iPhone 6, which as you know, was a big contributor to our phenomenal revenue growth a year ago. Most importantly, our customers are incredibly loyal. A recent Kantar survey of US smart phone purchasers indicated a 95% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured for any smart phone. 
Second, we continued to see a very high level of customers switching to iPhone from Android and other operating systems. In fact, we added more switchers from Android and other platforms in the first half of this year than any other six-month period ever. 
And third, with only 42% smart phone penetration of the global handset market today, iPhone is still attracting millions of first-time smart phone buyers each quarter, especially from emerging markets. For example, in India, our iPhone sales were up 56% from a year ago. 
Next, I'd like to talk about services, which was our second-largest revenue generating category during the quarter. Setting aside the amount we received from a patent settlement in the December quarter, the March quarter services revenue was our highest ever. Services revenue jumped 20% to $6 billion. App Store revenue was up 35% to beat last quarter's all-time record, and Apple Music continues to grow in popularity with over 13 million paying subscribers today. We feel really great about the early success of Apple's first subscription business, and our Music revenue has now hit an inflection point after many quarters of decline. 
The services business is powered by our huge installed base of active device, which crossed 1 billion units earlier this year. As we discussed on this call in January, those 1 billion-plus active devices are a source of recurring revenue that is growing independent of the unit shipments we report every three months. In fact, the purchase value of services tied to our installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the March quarter, up 27% over last year, accelerating from the 24% growth rate we reported in the December quarter.

In fact, the purchase value of services tied to our installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the March quarter, up 27% over last year, accelerating from the 24% growth rate we reported in the December quarter. \nThe reach of Apple Pay also continues to expand, following a very successful launch in China in the March quarter, and last week's roll-out in Singapore. Apple Pay is growing at a tremendous rate, with more than 5 times the transaction volume of a year ago, and 1 million new users per week. There are more than 10 million contactless ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay has launched today, including over 2.5 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States, and more expansion of Apple Pay is coming soon. \nTurning to the Mac, we met our sell-in expectations, in addition to reducing channel inventory by about 100,000 unites. Overall, the Mac continues to attract  a large percentage of new customers. In our latest survey of major markets, over half of buyers were new to the Mac, and in some countries, the percentage is extremely high, like in China, where over 80% of customers were purchasing a Mac for the first time. We're confident in our Mac business, and our ability to continue to innovate and gain share in that area. \nTurning to the Apple Watch, unit sales met our expectations in the quarter. For some color on how we think about Apple Watch sales, we expected seasonality to be similar to the historical seasonality of iPod, which typically generated 40% or more of its annual unit sell-through in the December  quarter. \nWe started shipping Apple  Watch just one year ago, and it has quickly become the best-selling and most loved smart watch in the world. In fact, unit sales of Apple Watch during its first year exceeded sales of iPhone in its first year. Last month, we refreshed the lineup for the spring with new bands and a new starting price point, and the response from customers has been great. \nApple Watch is an increasingly essential part of user's lives, from responding to messages, managing calendars and navigating with maps, to helping them  be more fit. And in some cases, the heart rate sensor has even helped save lives. We're really excited about the first year with Apple Watch. We have learned a lot, and we believe it has an exciting future ahead. \nWe announced some fantastic new products during the March quarter. iPhone SE became available on March 31, so none of its sales were reflected in our second-quarter results, but so far this quarter, we're seeing terrific customer response. iPhone SE is the most powerful four-inch phone ever, and it's a great option for customers all over the world who want a compact phone with advanced features, and a great price, without compromising performance. Demand has been very strong, and exceeds supply at this point, but we're working hard to get the iPhone SE into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible. The addition of the iPhone SE in the iPhone lineup places us in a better strategic position to attract even more customers into our ecosystem. \nWe also unveiled the stunning 9.7 inch iPad Pro, with cutting-edge performance and our most advanced display yet. The reviews of our new iPad Pros have been great, and we are hearing from customers of the features and capabilities in the new Pros make them both the ultimate upgrade for iPad owners, and a great PC replacement. \nIn the June quarter, we expect to see our best iPad revenue compare in over two years. iPad is the best-selling, best-reviewed and  most used tablet on the market. Customers tell us that they love iPad for its unique mix of portability, capability, and versatility, with over 1 million iPad apps in the App Store to help them work, play, learn, and create. \nWe also announced Care Kit, a new software framework that developers can use to help people take a more active role in their health, by keeping track of their care plans, monitoring their symptoms and medication, and delivering the insights they need to make smart decisions about their health. We're very excited about the ways iPhone and Apple Watch are helping people lead healthier lives. We believe there's great promise here for the future, and we are very interested in where this can take us. \nAs always, we are contributing to society beyond our products, promoting the use of renewable energy across our facilities and inside our supply chain, and developing cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize recycling in the materials we use. We are unwavering in our commitment to protect the security and privacy of our customers and their data, and we are actively promoting inclusion and equality across our business. \nAs we continue through the June quarter, I'd like to remind you that we measure the health of customer demand based on sell-through. Despite ending Q2 within our channel inventory targets, in light of the macroeconomic environment we plan to lower our channel inventories in the June quarter. This will impact our reported revenue in Q3. Luca will provide more details on this in his commentary. \nBut before turning over the call to him, I will summarize by saying that the future of Apple is very bright. Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store. We are very excited about bringing together developers for our four major platforms at our worldwide developers conference in June. \nWe are forging ahead with important investments in research and development, in our infrastructure, and in our supply chain. We've made 15 acquisitions in the last four quarters to accelerate our product and services roadmaps, and we are always on the lookout for companies with great technology, talent, and strategic fit. \nCreating value for shareholders by developing great products and services that enrich people's lives will always be our top priority, and the key factor driving our investments and capital allocation decisions. As our business continues to generate high levels of free cash flow, we are in the fortunate position to expand our capital return program again this year, as we have done each year since we started the program four years ago. \nToday, we are announcing an extension of the timeframe of the program by four quarters through March of 2018, and we are expanding the total program size from $200 billion to $250 billion. Luca has more details on this announcement and our results for the March quarter. Luca? \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLuca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with the March quarter results. Revenue for the quarter landed within our guidance range at $50.6 billion, compared to $58 billion in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 13%. \nAs we had expected, our comparisons to last year were influenced by the continued strength of the US dollar against foreign currencies. That being said, in constant currency, our revenue declined by 9%. On a geographic basis, in Asia, our revenue grew strongly in Japan, but it declined in greater China and the rest of Asia-Pacific. \nHowever our business in these two regions is faring better than the numbers might suggest. We had significant channel inventory reductions and currency weakness, which affected our reported revenue for both of these segments. In mainland China, revenue was down 11%, and the decline was 7% in constant currency terms. Keep in mind that we were up against an extremely difficult year-ago compare, when our mainland China revenue grew 81%. We remain very optimistic about the China market over the long-term, and we are committed to investing there for the long run. \nGross margin was 39.4%, near the high-end of our guidance range, thanks to strong cost performance. Operating margin was ""}","Apple Inc. reported their Q2 2016 earnings, revealing a challenging quarter but also demonstrating excellent execution by the team in the face of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds. The company's revenue for the quarter was $50.6 billion, within their guidance range. However, when adjusted for currency weakness, revenue declined by 9% in constant currency.

Apple highlighted several encouraging signs, including the continued growth of their installed base of over 1 billion active devices. They also added a significant number of Android switchers and new-to-Mac customers during the quarter. Additionally, their services category generated strong growth, with services revenue reaching a record $6 billion, up 20% from the previous year. The App Store revenue was particularly strong, up 35% and Apple Music saw continued growth with over 13 million paying subscribers.

iPhone sales in the quarter reached 51.2 million units, consistent with expectations, but lower than the exceptional year-ago quarter. Apple noted that iPhone sales come from three sources: upgrades, customers switching from other operating systems, and first-time smartphone buyers. The upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle was slightly higher than the iPhone 5s cycle, but lower than the accelerated upgrade rate seen with the iPhone 6.

Apple saw a high level of customers switching to iPhone from Android and other platforms, adding more switchers in the first half of the year than ever before. They also highlighted the strong demand for iPhone in emerging markets, with sales in India up 56% from the previous year.

The company expressed confidence in the Mac business, with a large percentage of new customers and strong innovation. Apple Watch unit sales met expectations and exceeded iPhone sales in its first year. The new products unveiled during the quarter, including the iPhone SE and 9.7-inch iPad Pro, received positive reviews.

Apple reaffirmed their commitment to research and development, making investments in infrastructure and supply chain. They also announced an extension of their capital return program, with an increase in program size from $200 billion to $250 billion and an extension of the timeframe through March 2018.

Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, Apple remains optimistic about the future and expressed excitement about their product pipeline and the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference. They will continue to focus on creating value for shareholders and developing products and services that enrich people's lives.",gpt-3

Apple saw strong performance in several areas, including its Services business, which had its best quarter ever with revenue of $11.5 billion. iPad revenue increased by 22% year over year, the highest growth rate in six years, while Wearables experienced nearly 50% growth. The company also saw growth in developed markets, with record results in major markets such as the US, Canada, UK, and Japan. However, there was a revenue decline in emerging markets. Apple is positive about the trajectory in China, where revenue performance improved relative to the previous quarter. The company attributes this improvement to positive customer response to pricing actions, trading and financing programs in retail stores, government stimulus measures, and improved US-China trade dialogue. Apple mentioned that the App Store results in China were impacted by regulatory slowdown, but they are encouraged by the recent increase in pace of approvals. They believe in the long-term opportunity in China due to the country's robust ecosystem and tech-savvy consumers. iPhone revenue was down 17% year over year, although the decline was smaller in the final weeks of the quarter. Apple stated that customer satisfaction and loyalty are reflected in the growing active installed base of devices, which is driving the growth of the Services business. Apple had its best quarter ever for the App Store, Apple Music, Cloud Services, and App Store Search Ad business. The company also highlighted its new services, including Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Arcade, and Apple TV+. Apple announced the expansion of its recycling programs and its goal of transitioning to 100% clean energy. Overall, Apple is optimistic about its future and looks forward to sharing more information about its software platforms at its Worldwide Developers Conference.",gpt-3

- **Revenue and Earnings**: Apple reported revenue of $42.4 billion for Q3 2016, which was close to the high end of its guidance range, with net income at $7.8 billion and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.42. The gross margin (GM) stood at 38%, aligning with the top of their guidance range. These results came despite a significant inventory reduction.

- **Channel Inventory**: The company achieved these results in part through a substantial reduction of channel inventory by approximately $3.6 billion, exceeding the expected $2 billion. The majority of this reduction was in the iPhone sector. Apple ended the quarter with its channel inventory levels well-positioned for future periods.

- **Guidance for Next Quarter**: Apple provided a revenue guidance of between $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion for Q4 2016.

**Product Performance:**

- **iPhone**: The iPhone sell-through was down by 8% year over year but showed improvement over expectations. The iPhone SE had a successful launch, with demand outstripping supply throughout the quarter. The iPhone SE was particularly successful in attracting new customers to the ecosystem, evident in sales data and the high rate of switchers to iPhones.

- **Services**: Apple's services sector grew 19% to a June quarter record of $6 billion, bolstered by revenue growth in the App Store (up by 37%), Music, iCloud, and AppleCare. Over the last 12 months, services revenue grew by nearly $4 billion year over year, to $23.1 billion. The active installed base fuelled this growth with installed base related purchases growing by 29% year over year.

- **Apple Watch**: The Apple Watch continued to be the best-selling smartwatch, with customer satisfaction ranking highest among all smartwatches according to J.D. Power.

**Market Dynamics & Geographic Performance:**

- **China**: Despite facing economic slowdown and weakened consumer confidence in Greater China, Apple grew its installed base of iPhones by 34% year over year. Challenges included currency depreciation and a particularly strong Hong Kong dollar impacting tourism and retail.

- **India**: India emerged as one of Apple's fastest-growing markets, having experienced a 51% growth in iPhone sales year over year.

**Capital Expenditure & Cash Position:**

- **Spending**: Apple's capital expenditure in Q3 2016 was $4.2 billion. The company also conducted share repurchases amounting to 41.2 million shares for $4 billion.

- **Cash Reserves**: By the end of Q3 2016, Apple's cash plus marketable securities totaled $231.5 billion.

**Capital Structure & Future Outlook:**

- **Operating Expenses**: The operating margin was reported at 23.9% of revenue for Q3 2016. The cash flow from operations was $10.6 billion.

- **Product and Region-Specific Insights**:
    - **iPhone**: Apple sold 40.4 million iPhones and exited the quarter near the low-end of the 5-7 week target range for channel inventory. The iPhone SE rollout coincided with a channel inventory reduction of over 4 million higher-end iPhones, affecting the average selling price (ASP) to fall to $595. However, ASPs are expected to increase in the following quarter.
    - **Mac**: Sales of Mac were down to 4.3 million units from 4.8 million in the previous year within the context of a contracting global personal computer market.
    - **iPad**: Apple's revenue from iPad grew by 7%, fueled largely by the iPad Pro, and sold 10 million iPads during the quarter.
  
**Artificial Intelligence & Innovation:**

- **AI and Machine Learning**: Apple is advancing in AI, focusing on enhancing user experience by integrating machine learning into products like Siri, Photos, Messages, Mail, and Maps.

- **New Developments**: Apple is looking forward to software and services it previewed, including iOS 10 and macOS Sierra, which include features such as Siri and Apple Pay on the Mac.

Notably, the tech giant returned to growth with a quarterly revenue of $53.8 billion, a slight year-over-year increase. However, the revenue faced a negative impact from foreign exchange rates, which created a 300 basis point drag from the previous year, equivalent to about a $1.5 billion reduction in top-line growth.

The company's net income stood at $10 billion for the quarter with diluted earnings per share (EPS) at $2.18. Applying a dissected approach to its product lines, iPhone revenue declined by 12% year-over-year to $26 billion, an improvement over the 17% drop seen in the previous quarter. Apple attributed this recovery to the strong customer response to various promotional programs such as in-store trade-ins and financing options.

On the other hand, non-iPhone revenue surged by 17%, indicating robust expansion in other business arenas. Mac and iPad displayed strong performances with iPad Pro leading the charge and new releases like iPad Mini and iPad Air resonating well with consumers. The iPad sales generated over $5 billion, sustaining a growth trend for the third consecutive quarter.

A significant highlight is the Wearables category, which accelerated to growth well over 50%, marking the Apple Watch and AirPods as drivers within Apple's portfolio. In fact, the Wearables' business over the previous four quarters surpassed the size of over 60% of the companies in the Fortune 500.

Services continued its upward trajectory with a record revenue of $11.5 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year or 15%-18% on a constant-currency basis. This growth was broad-based, with records in AppleCare, Apple Music, Cloud Services, and the App store's search ads. Apple Pay, specifically, almost doubled its transaction volume year-over-year, further marking Apple's advancement in the digital payment space.

Geographically, Apple displayed a turnaround with a return to growth in Mainland China and positive revenue growth across all geographic segments when adjusted for constant currency. Seasonality effects were not explicitly mentioned, keeping the narrative focused on year-over-year comparisons.

Looking ahead, Apple forecasts fourth-quarter revenue to be between $61-64 billion. This guidance hinges on sustained product performances and new launches. A strategic move was revealed in the acquisition of the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business, aiming to bolster Apple's technological capabilities and patent portfolio.

Capital return to investors continued with nearly 88 million Apple shares repurchased for $17 billion. The company's liquidity remains strong, sitting on a cash and marketable securities pile of almost $211 billion, counterbalanced by total debt of $108 billion.

In terms of R&D and innovation, several software updates and ecosystem enhancements were announced ‚Äì with iOS, macOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS receiving key upgrades designed to bolster user experience and further entrench the company's market positioning.

Apple's commitment to owning and controlling core technologies was underscored by the strategic acquisition of the smartphone modem business and the substantial investment in wireless technology patents. Despite no specific discussion on EBITDA, capital expenditure, cost savings, free cash flow, or hedging, the company's ability to generate substantial earnings and invest in future growth opportunities was evident. 

This narrative refrains from speculating on unmentioned areas such as organic growth, margins, and operating expenses, focusing instead on concrete data and qualified insights provided in the earnings call.",gpt-4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. 1Q19 Business Review (T.C.)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1. Highlights:
          1. Dec. qtr. revenue, $84.3b.
               1. Below original expectations.
               2. Down 5% YoverY, or 3% adjusting for FX.
          2. Noted four factors that would impact results when Co. provided guidance in Nov.:
               1. Different iPhone launch timing from a year ago.
               2. FX headwinds.
               3. Supply constraints on certain products.
               4. Macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets.
          3. Weak macro conditions in some emerging markets were significantly more severe than Co. originally foresaw, especially in Greater China.
               1. Compounded by quarterly iPhone upgrades that were lower than anticipated.
               2. Greater China revenue down $4.8b YoverY, with declines across:
                    1. iPhone.
                    2. Mac.
                    3. iPad.
               3. Most shortfalls relative to regional guidance, and over 100% of worldwide YoverY revenue decline was driven by performance in Greater China.
          4. Despite iPhone upgrades being lower than anticipated, Co.'s business grew outside of China, including new records in:
               1. Americas.
               2. Western Europe.
               3. Central and Eastern Europe.
               4. Rest of Asia Pacific.

               4. Germany.
               5. Italy.
               6. Spain.
               7. Korea.
          6. In the letter shared earlier this month, Co. said it is proud to participate in Chinese marketplace and that it believes AAPL's business has a bright future there over time.
          7. Generated record Dec. qtr. Services revenue in Greater China, fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over 2.5m registered iOS developers.
               1. Saw strong results from wearables business, there with revenues up over 50%.
          8. Continued to grow total active installed base by adding new customers.
               1. More than two-thirds of all customers in China who bought a Mac or an iPad during Dec. qtr. were purchasing that product for first time.
          9. Despite challenging Dec. qtr., revenue from China grew slightly for full calendar year.
               1. Macroeconomic factors will come and go.
               2. Sees great upside and continuing to focus on things that Co. can control.
     2. iPhone:
          1. iPhone XR, iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max are by far the best iPhones Co. has ever shipped.
               1. They share advanced technologies, including A12 Bionic, the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone with Co.'s next generation Neural Engine capable of 5t operations per second.
          2. Proud of iPhone lineup, and Co.'s industry-leading customer satisfaction.
               1. Wouldn't change position for anyone.
          3. Customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in past.
               1. Pairing this with a macroeconomic factor, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue down 15% from last year.
          4. Results accounted for significantly more than entire YoverY revenue decline.
               1. Outside of iPhone, business grew strongly, by 19%.
          5. From a customer perspective, Co. believes [aforementioned] is the sum of several factors.
               1. FX:
                    1. Relative strength of US dollar has made Co.'s products more expensive in many parts of world.
                    2. In Turkey, lira depreciated by 33% over course of calendar 2018 and in Dec. qtr., revenue there was down by almost $700m from previous year.
               2. Subsidy:
                    1. For various reasons, iPhone subsidies are becoming increasingly less common.
                    2. In Japan, iPhone purchases were traditionally subsidized by carriers and bundled with service contract.
                    3. Competitive promotional activity frequently increased amount of subsidy during key period.
                    4. Today, local regulations have significantly restricted those subsidies and related competition.
                    5. Thereby, Co. estimates that less than half of iPhone sold in Japan in 1Q19 were subsidized vs. about three-quarters a year ago and that total value of those subsidies had come down.
               3. Battery replacement program:
                    1. For millions of customers, Co. made it inexpensive and efficient to replace battery and hold on to their existing iPhones a bit longer.
                    2. Some people suggested that Co. shouldn't have done this because of potential impact on upgrades, but Co. strongly believes, it was right thing to do for customers.
               4. Despite aforementioned factors, total active installed base of devices has grown from 1.3b at Jan.-end 2018 to 1.4b by end of Dec., reaching a new all-time high for each of main product categories and for all five geographic segments.
     3. Services:
          1. Large and growing installed base is a powerful testament to satisfaction and loyalty of customers, but it's also fueling fast growing Services business.
          2. Services revenue set an all-time record, at $10.9b in Dec. qtr., growing 19%.
               1. Had all-time records across multiple categories of services including App Store, Apple Pay, Cloud services and App Store Search Ads business.
                    1. Had Dec. qtr. record for AppleCare.
          3. Nearly 16 years after launching iTunes Store, Co. generated highest quarterly music revenue ever due to popularity of Apple Music, now with over 50m paid subscribers.
          4. App Store wrapped up its best year ever, with record holiday period results propelled by biggest Christmas Day and Christmas week ever.
               1. Customers spent over $322m on New Year's Day alone, setting a new single day record for number of customers and purchase volume.

                    2. Belgium.
                    3. Kazakhstan.
               5. Live in 27 markets around the world.
                    1. Rollout in Germany has been a huge success with Deutsche Bank reporting more activations for Apple Pay in one week than for Android in an entire year.

Highlights:\n          1. Dec. qtr. revenue, $84.3b.\n               1. Below original expectations.\n               2. Down 5% YoverY, or 3% adjusting for FX.\n          2. Noted four factors that would impact results when Co. provided guidance in Nov.:\n               1. Different iPhone launch timing from a year ago.\n               2. FX headwinds.\n               3. Supply constraints on certain products.\n               4. Macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets.\n          3. Weak macro conditions in some emerging markets were significantly more severe than Co. originally foresaw, especially in Greater China.\n               1. Compounded by quarterly iPhone upgrades that were lower than anticipated.\n               2. Greater China revenue down $4.8b YoverY, with declines across:\n                    1. iPhone.\n                    2. Mac.\n                    3. iPad.\n               3. Most shortfalls relative to regional guidance, and over 100% of worldwide YoverY revenue decline was driven by performance in Greater China.\n          4. Despite iPhone upgrades being lower than anticipated, Co.'s business grew outside of China, including new records in:\n               1. Americas.\n               2. Western Europe.\n               3. Central and Eastern Europe.\n               4. Rest of Asia Pacific.\n          5. Had record performance in large markets, including:\n               1. US.\n               2. Canada.\n               3. Mexico.\n               4. Germany.\n               5. Italy.\n               6. Spain.\n               7. Korea.\n          6. In the letter shared earlier this month, Co. said it is proud to participate in Chinese marketplace and that it believes AAPL's business has a bright future there over time.\n          7. Generated record Dec. qtr. Services revenue in Greater China, fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over 2.5m registered iOS developers.\n               1. Saw strong results from wearables business, there with revenues up over 50%.\n          8. Continued to grow total active installed base by adding new customers.\n               1. More than two-thirds of all customers in China who bought a Mac or an iPad during Dec. qtr. were purchasing that product for first time.\n          9. Despite challenging Dec. qtr., revenue from China grew slightly for full calendar year.\n               1. Macroeconomic factors will come and go.\n               2. Sees great upside and continuing to focus on things that Co. can control.\n     2. iPhone:\n          1. iPhone XR, iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max are by far the best iPhones Co. has ever shipped.\n               1. They share advanced technologies, including A12 Bionic, the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone with Co.'s next generation Neural Engine capable of 5t operations per second.\n          2. Proud of iPhone lineup, and Co.'s industry-leading customer satisfaction.\n               1. Wouldn't change position for anyone.\n          3. Customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in past.\n               1. Pairing this with a macroeconomic factor, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue down 15% from last year.\n          4. Results accounted for significantly more than entire YoverY revenue decline.\n               1. Outside of iPhone, business grew strongly, by 19%.\n          5. From a customer perspective, Co. believes [aforementioned] is the sum of several factors.\n               1. FX:\n                    1. Relative strength of US dollar has made Co.'s products more expensive in many parts of world.\n                    2. In Turkey, lira depreciated by 33% over course of calendar 2018 and in Dec. qtr., revenue there was down by almost $700m from previous year.\n               2. Subsidy:\n                    1. For various reasons, iPhone subsidies are becoming increasingly less common.\n                    2. In Japan, iPhone purchases were traditionally subsidized by carriers and bundled with service contract.\n                    3. Competitive promotional activity frequently increased amount of subsidy during key period.\n                    4. Today, local regulations have significantly restricted those subsidies and related competition.\n                    5. Thereby, Co. estimates that less than half of iPhone sold in Japan in 1Q19 were subsidized vs. about three-quarters a year ago and that total value of those subsidies had come down.\n               3. Battery replacement program:\n                    1. For millions of customers, Co. made it inexpensive and efficient to replace battery and hold on to their existing iPhones a bit longer.\n                    2. Some people suggested that Co. shouldn't have done this because of potential impact on upgrades, but Co. strongly believes, it was right thing to do for customers.\n               4. Despite aforementioned factors, total active installed base of devices has grown from 1.3b at Jan.-end 2018 to 1.4b by end of Dec., reaching a new all-time high for each of main product categories and for all five geographic segments.\n     3. Services:\n          1. Large and growing installed base is a powerful testament to satisfaction and loyalty of customers, but it's also fueling fast growing Services business.\n          2. Services revenue set an all-time record, at $10.9b in Dec. qtr., growing 19%.\n               1. Had all-time records across multiple categories of services including App Store, Apple Pay, Cloud services and App Store Search Ads business.\n                    1. Had Dec. qtr. record for AppleCare.\n          3. Nearly 16 years after launching iTunes Store, Co. generated highest quarterly music revenue ever due to popularity of Apple Music, now with over 50m paid subscribers.\n          4. App Store wrapped up its best year ever, with record holiday period results propelled by biggest Christmas Day and Christmas week ever.\n               1. Customers spent over $322m on New Year's Day alone, setting a new single day record for number of customers and purchase volume.\n          5. Great holiday season for Apple Pay with over 1.8b transactions; well over twice the volume of 1Q18.\n               1. Merchant adoption continues to reach new milestone.\n               2. Customers can now use Apple Pay with iPhone and Apple Watch at nearly 3,000 Speedway locations.\n               3. While all Target, Taco Bell and Jack in the Box stores will be accepting Apple Pay soon.\n               4. Launched in three new countries in Dec. qtr.:\n                    1. Germany.\n                    2. Belgium.\n                    3. Kazakhstan.\n               5. Live in 27 markets around the world.\n                    1. Rollout in Germany has been a huge success with Deutsche Bank reporting more activations for Apple Pay in one week than for Android in an entire year.\n          6. Revenue from Cloud Services continues to grow rapidly with YoverY revenue up over 40% in Dec. qtr.\n               1. Readership of Apple News set a new record with over 85m monthly active users in three countries where Co. has launched:\n                    1. US.\n                    2. UK.\n                    3. Australia.\n               2. In US, latest data from comScore shows that Apple News has largest audience of all news apps.\n               3. International audience will continue to grow with Co.'s first ever bilingual launch in Canada, available to customers later this qtr.\n          7. Happy with growth and breadth of Services portfolio.\n               1. Revenue from Services has grown from less than $8b in calendar 2010 to over $41b in calendar 2018.\n               2. Largest category represents less than 30% of total Services revenue and new services launched in last few years are all experiencing tremendous growth.\n     4. Others:\n          1. Mac:\n               1. Best qtr. ever.\n               2. Revenue up 9%, fueled by new MacBook Air and Mac Mini, introduced in Oct.\n          2. iPad:\n               1. Revenue up 17%.\n               2. Highest growth rate in almost six years, powered by new iPad Pro released in Nov.\n          3. Wearables, Home and Accessories:\n               1.

Highly satisfied and loyal customers.\n                    2. Large and growing active installed base.\n                    3. Deeply ingrained culture of innovation.\n          5.

The company posted Q1 2019 revenues of $84.3 billion, marking a 5% year-over-year decline, attributed to specific challenges and moderated expectations. Net income remained relatively stable at $20 billion, translating into a diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.18, a 7.5% increase from the previous year. Apple provided future revenue guidance for 2019 in the range of $55 to $59 billion, reflective of the uncertainties and strategies in play.

**Revenue Drivers and Challenges:**
- Apple recognized a significant revenue shortfall in Greater China, totaling a $4.8 billion decline across iPhone, Mac, and iPad. This downturn was attributed to weakness in the macroeconomic environment and fewer iPhone upgrades than expected.
- Despite lower iPhone upgrades, Apple grew in other regions such as the Americas, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, and the Asia Pacific, setting new records in various large markets including the US, Canada, Mexico, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Korea.
- The company indicated an active installed base growth, with over two-thirds of Mac and iPad customers in China being first-time buyers, leading to an overall revenue growth in China for the calendar year.
- Challenges cited for the period included different iPhone launch timing, currency exchange headwinds, supply constraints on certain products, and tough macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets.

**Product Performance:**
- iPhone revenue experienced a 15% drop, a significant factor contributing to the company's overall revenue decline. External influences like a strong US dollar and reduced carrier subsidies played roles in this reduction, along with an impactful battery replacement program that extended the life of older iPhones.
- Services achieved an all-time high of $10.9 billion in revenue, marking a 19% growth, propelled by the App Store, Apple Pay, Cloud services, and a record in AppleCare. Apple Music reached 50 million paid subscribers.
- The Mac, iPad, and Wearables, Home, and Accessories categories all witnessed growth. Mac revenue was up 9%, iPad's by 17%, and the wearables section saw a 33% increase, each setting new records for the quarter.

**Financial Indicators and Capital Structure:**
- Gross margin (GM) stood at 38% with further breakdowns showing products GM at 34.3% and services GM at 62.8%.
- Operating cash flow was strong at $26.7 billion.
- End-of-quarter cash plus marketable securities was reported at $245 billion, and the term debt was at $102.8 billion.
- Apple repurchased 38 million shares for $8.2 billion through open market transactions.

**Forward Guidance:**
- Apple's guidance for 2019 revenue of $55 to $59 billion takes into account the challenging macro conditions, particularly in emerging markets. 
- The company plans to focus on areas within its control and is undeterred by short-term market shifts, signaling confidence in long-term fundamental business strength.
- Future investments indicate a commitment to product and service innovations, with both new offerings and geographic rollouts planned.
  
The narrative provided by both CEO Timothy D. Cook and CFO Luca Maestri frames a mixed financial outlook. Apple's strategic responses to market challenges include trade-in facilitation, expanded installment payment options, and growing the active installed base to support the burgeoning services business. Noteworthy is an underlying optimism for the Chinese market and a continued push for innovation despite forecasted headwinds.",gpt-4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. 1Q19 Business Review (T.C.)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1. Highlights:
          1. Dec. qtr. revenue, $84.3b.
               1. Below original expectations.
               2. Down 5% YoverY, or 3% adjusting for FX.
          2. Noted four factors that would impact results when Co. provided guidance in Nov.:
               1. Different iPhone launch timing from a year ago.
               2. FX headwinds.
               3. Supply constraints on certain products.
               4. Macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets.
          3. Weak macro conditions in some emerging markets were significantly more severe than Co. originally foresaw, especially in Greater China.
               1. Compounded by quarterly iPhone upgrades that were lower than anticipated.
               2. Greater China revenue down $4.8b YoverY, with declines across:
                    1. iPhone.
                    2. Mac.
                    3. iPad.
               3. Most shortfalls relative to regional guidance, and over 100% of worldwide YoverY revenue decline was driven by performance in Greater China.
          4. Despite iPhone upgrades being lower than anticipated, Co.'s business grew outside of China, including new records in:
               1. Americas.
               2. Western Europe.
               3. Central and Eastern Europe.
               4. Rest of Asia Pacific.
          5. Had record performance in large markets, including:
               1. US.
               2. Canada.
               3. Mexico.
               4. Germany.
               5. Italy.
               6. Spain.
               7. Korea.
          6. In the letter shared earlier this month, Co. said it is proud to participate in Chinese marketplace and that it believes AAPL's business has a bright future there over time.
          7. Generated record Dec. qtr. Services revenue in Greater China, fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over 2.5m registered iOS developers.
               1. Saw strong results from wearables business, there with revenues up over 50%.
          8. Continued to grow total active installed base by adding new customers.
               1. More than two-thirds of all customers in China who bought a Mac or an iPad during Dec. qtr. were purchasing that product for first time.
          9. Despite challenging Dec. qtr., revenue from China grew slightly for full calendar year.
               1. Macroeconomic factors will come and go.
               2. Sees great upside and continuing to focus on things that Co. can control.
     2. iPhone:
          1. iPhone XR, iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max are by far the best iPhones Co. has ever shipped.
               1. They share advanced technologies, including A12 Bionic, the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone with Co.'s next generation Neural Engine capable of 5t operations per second.
          2. Proud of iPhone lineup, and Co.'s industry-leading customer satisfaction.
               1. Wouldn't change position for anyone.
          3. Customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in past.
               1. Pairing this with a macroeconomic factor, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue down 15% from last year.
          4. Results accounted for significantly more than entire YoverY revenue decline.
               1. Outside of iPhone, business grew strongly, by 19%.
          5. From a customer perspective, Co. believes [aforementioned] is the sum of several factors.
               1. FX:
                    1. Relative strength of US dollar has made Co.'s products more expensive in many parts of world.
                    2. In Turkey, lira depreciated by 33% over course of calendar 2018 and in Dec. qtr., revenue there was down by almost $700m from previous year.
               2. Subsidy:
                    1. For various reasons, iPhone subsidies are becoming increasingly less common.
                    2. In Japan, iPhone purchases were traditionally subsidized by carriers and bundled with service contract.
                    3. Competitive promotional activity frequently increased amount of subsidy during key period.
                    4. Today, local regulations have significantly restricted those subsidies and related competition.
                    5. Thereby, Co. estimates that less than half of iPhone sold in Japan in 1Q19 were subsidized vs. about three-quarters a year ago and that total value of those subsidies had come down.
               3. Battery replacement program:
                    1. For millions of customers, Co. made it inexpensive and efficient to replace battery and hold on to their existing iPhones a bit longer.
                    2. Some people suggested that Co. shouldn't have done this because of potential impact on upgrades, but Co. strongly believes, it was right thing to do for customers.
               4. Despite aforementioned factors, total active installed base of devices has grown from 1.3b at Jan.-end 2018 to 1.4b by end of Dec., reaching a new all-time high for each of main product categories and for all five geographic segments.
     3. Services:
          1. Large and growing installed base is a powerful testament to satisfaction and loyalty of customers, but it's also fueling fast growing Services business.
          2. Services revenue set an all-time record, at $10.9b in Dec. qtr., growing 19%.
               1. Had all-time records across multiple categories of services including App Store, Apple Pay, Cloud services and App Store Search Ads business.
                    1. Had Dec. qtr. record for AppleCare.
          3. Nearly 16 years after launching iTunes Store, Co. generated highest quarterly music revenue ever due to popularity of Apple Music, now with over 50m paid subscribers.
          4. App Store wrapped up its best year ever, with record holiday period results propelled by biggest Christmas Day and Christmas week ever.
               1. Customers spent over $322m on New Year's Day alone, setting a new single day record for number of customers and purchase volume.
          5. Great holiday season for Apple Pay with over 1.8b transactions; well over twice the volume of 1Q18.
               1. Merchant adoption continues to reach new milestone.
               2. Customers can now use Apple Pay with iPhone and Apple Watch at nearly 3,000 Speedway locations.
               3. While all Target, Taco Bell and Jack in the Box stores will be accepting Apple Pay soon.
               4. Launched in three new countries in Dec. qtr.:
                    1. Germany.
                    2. Belgium.
                    3. Kazakhstan.
               5. Live in 27 markets around the world.
                    1. Rollout in Germany has been a huge success with Deutsche Bank reporting more activations for Apple Pay in one week than for Android in an entire year.
          6. Revenue from Cloud Services continues to grow rapidly with YoverY revenue up over 40% in Dec. qtr.
               1. Readership of Apple News set a new record with over 85m monthly active users in three countries where Co. has launched:
                    1. US.
                    2. UK.
                    3. Australia.
               2. In US, latest data from comScore shows that Apple News has largest audience of all news apps.
               3. International audience will continue to grow with Co.'s first ever bilingual launch in Canada, available to customers later this qtr.
          7. Happy with growth and breadth of Services portfolio.
               1. Revenue from Services has grown from less than $8b in calendar 2010 to over $41b in calendar 2018.
               2. Largest category represents less than 30% of total Services revenue and new services launched in last few years are all experiencing tremendous growth.
     4. Others:
          1. Mac:
               1. Best qtr. ever.
               2. Revenue up 9%, fueled by new MacBook Air and Mac Mini, introduced in Oct.
          2. iPad:
               1. Revenue up 17%.
               2. Highest growth rate in almost six years, powered by new iPad Pro released in Nov.
          3. Wearables, Home and Accessories:
               1. Had best qtr. ever with 33% growth in total, and almost 50% growth from wearables due to strong sales of Apple Watch and AirPods.
          4. Co. doesn't measure success in 90 day increments; manages Co. for long-term.
               1. When considering keys to success over time, there are three that stand out:
                    1. Highly satisfied and loyal customers.
                    2. Large and growing active installed base.
                    3. Deeply ingrained culture of innovation.
          5. Has an amazingly talented team, creating hardware, software and services, optimizing each of them to create an unparalleled user experience.

               2. Has embedded machine learning directly into silicon with A12 Bionic chip.
                    1. Custom Neural Engine provides power efficiency and incredible performance in a small package, but it enables processing of data and transactions directly on device.
                    2. iPhone can recognize pattern, make prediction and learn from experience, all while keeping personal information private.
          6. Undertaking and accelerating a number of initiatives to improve results.
               1. Making it simple to trade in an iPhone in stores and raising awareness of this opportunity.
                    1. Because of quality and durability of iPhone, they maintain significant residual value, making trade-ins a great opportunity.
                    2. It's not only great for environment, it's great for customer as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it's great for developers as phone that has traded in and redistributed can help grow Co.'s active installed base.
               2. Beginning last week, Co. started making it easier for people to pay for their phones over time with installment payments.
                    1. Working on rolling out this program to more geographies as soon as Co. can.

Generated record Dec. qtr. Services revenue in Greater China, fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over 2.5m registered iOS developers.\n               1. Saw strong results from wearables business, there with revenues up over 50%.\n          8. Continued to grow total active installed base by adding new customers.\n               1. More than two-thirds of all customers in China who bought a Mac or an iPad during Dec. qtr. were purchasing that product for first time.\n          9. Despite challenging Dec. qtr., revenue from China grew slightly for full calendar year.\n               1. Macroeconomic factors will come and go.\n               2. Sees great upside and continuing to focus on things that Co. can control.\n     2. iPhone:\n          1. iPhone XR, iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max are by far the best iPhones Co. has ever shipped.\n               1. They share advanced technologies, including A12 Bionic, the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone with Co.'s next generation Neural Engine capable of 5t operations per second.\n          2. Proud of iPhone lineup, and Co.'s industry-leading customer satisfaction.\n               1. Wouldn't change position for anyone.\n          3. Customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in past.\n               1. Pairing this with a macroeconomic factor, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue down 15% from last year.\n          4. Results accounted for significantly more than entire YoverY revenue decline.\n               1. Outside of iPhone, business grew strongly, by 19%.\n          5. From a customer perspective, Co. believes [aforementioned] is the sum of several factors.\n               1. FX:\n                    1. Relative strength of US dollar has made Co.'s products more expensive in many parts of world.\n                    2. In Turkey, lira depreciated by 33% over course of calendar 2018 and in Dec. qtr., revenue there was down by almost $700m from previous year.\n               2. Subsidy:\n                    1. For various reasons, iPhone subsidies are becoming increasingly less common.\n                    2. In Japan, iPhone purchases were traditionally subsidized by carriers and bundled with service contract.\n                    3. Competitive promotional activity frequently increased amount of subsidy during key period.\n                    4. Today, local regulations have significantly restricted those subsidies and related competition.\n                    5. Thereby, Co. estimates that less than half of iPhone sold in Japan in 1Q19 were subsidized vs. about three-quarters a year ago and that total value of those subsidies had come down.\n               3. Battery replacement program:\n                    1. For millions of customers, Co. made it inexpensive and efficient to replace battery and hold on to their existing iPhones a bit longer.\n                    2. Some people suggested that Co. shouldn't have done this because of potential impact on upgrades, but Co. strongly believes, it was right thing to do for customers.\n               4. Despite aforementioned factors, total active installed base of devices has grown from 1.3b at Jan.-end 2018 to 1.4b by end of Dec., reaching a new all-time high for each of main product categories and for all five geographic segments.\n     3. Services:\n          1. Large and growing installed base is a powerful testament to satisfaction and loyalty of customers, but it's also fueling fast growing Services business.\n          2. Services revenue set an all-time record, at $10.9b in Dec. qtr., growing 19%.\n               1. Had all-time records across multiple categories of services including App Store, Apple Pay, Cloud services and App Store Search Ads business.\n                    1. Had Dec. qtr. record for AppleCare.\n          3. Nearly 16 years after launching iTunes Store, Co. generated highest quarterly music revenue ever due to popularity of Apple Music, now with over 50m paid subscribers.\n          4. App Store wrapped up its best year ever, with record holiday period results propelled by biggest Christmas Day and Christmas week ever.\n               1. Customers spent over $322m on New Year's Day alone, setting a new single day record for number of customers and purchase volume.\n          5. Great holiday season for Apple Pay with over 1.8b transactions; well over twice the volume of 1Q18.\n               1. Merchant adoption continues to reach new milestone.\n               2. Customers can now use Apple Pay with iPhone and Apple Watch at nearly 3,000 Speedway locations.\n               3. While all Target, Taco Bell and Jack in the Box stores will be accepting Apple Pay soon.\n               4. Launched in three new countries in Dec. qtr.:\n                    1. Germany.\n                    2. Belgium.\n                    3. Kazakhstan.\n               5. Live in 27 markets around the world.\n                    1. Rollout in Germany has been a huge success with Deutsche Bank reporting more activations for Apple Pay in one week than for Android in an entire year.\n          6. Revenue from Cloud Services continues to grow rapidly with YoverY revenue up over 40% in Dec. qtr.\n               1. Readership of Apple News set a new record with over 85m monthly active users in three countries where Co. has launched:\n                    1. US.\n                    2. UK.\n                    3. Australia.\n               2. In US, latest data from comScore shows that Apple News has largest audience of all news apps.\n               3. International audience will continue to grow with Co.'s first ever bilingual launch in Canada, available to customers later this qtr.\n          7. Happy with growth and breadth of Services portfolio.\n               1. Revenue from Services has grown from less than $8b in calendar 2010 to over $41b in calendar 2018.\n               2. Largest category represents less than 30% of total Services revenue and new services launched in last few years are all experiencing tremendous growth.\n     4. Others:\n          1. Mac:\n               1. Best qtr. ever.\n               2. Revenue up 9%, fueled by new MacBook Air and Mac Mini, introduced in Oct.\n          2. iPad:\n               1. Revenue up 17%.\n               2. Highest growth rate in almost six years, powered by new iPad Pro released in Nov.\n          3. Wearables, Home and Accessories:\n               1. Had best qtr. ever with 33% growth in total, and almost 50% growth from wearables due to strong sales of Apple Watch and AirPods.\n          4. Co. doesn't measure success in 90 day increments; manages Co. for long-term.\n               1. When considering keys to success over time, there are three that stand out:\n                    1. Highly satisfied and loyal customers.\n                    2. Large and growing active installed base.\n                    3. Deeply ingrained culture of innovation.\n          5. Has an amazingly talented team, creating hardware, software and services, optimizing each of them to create an unparalleled user experience.\n               1. Apple Watch is a powerful example of this.\n                    1. Believes Co. is just beginning to see impact it can make to improving health and is deeply inspired by possibility.\n               2. Has embedded machine learning directly into silicon with A12 Bionic chip.\n                    1. Custom Neural Engine provides power efficiency and incredible performance in a small package, but it enables processing of data and transactions directly on device.\n                    2. iPhone can recognize pattern, make prediction and learn from experience, all while keeping personal information private.\n          6. Undertaking and accelerating a number of initiatives to improve results.\n               1. Making it simple to trade in an iPhone in stores and raising awareness of this opportunity.\n                    1. Because of quality and durability of iPhone, they maintain significant residual value, making trade-ins a great opportunity.\n                    2. It's not only great for environment, it's great for customer as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it's great for developers as phone that has traded in and redistributed can help grow Co.'s active installed base.\n               2. Beginning last week, Co. started making it easier for people to pay for their phones over time with installment payments.\n                    1. Working on rolling out this program to more geographies as soon as Co. can.\n     5. Summary:\n          1. Confident in fundamental strength of Co.'s business.\n          2. Has a strong pipeline of products and services with some exciting announcements coming later this year.\n          3.

Services GM 62.8%.\n               2.

Revenue $52b.\n        ""}","According to the earnings call transcript for Q1 2019, Apple reported revenues of $84.3 billion, net income of $20 billion, and diluted EPS of $4.18. However, these figures were below the original expectations. The company expects revenues for 2019 to be in the range of $55 billion to $59 billion.

The decline in revenues was attributed to several factors, including the timing of iPhone launches, FX headwinds, supply constraints on certain products, and macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets. Weak macro conditions in some emerging markets, particularly in Greater China, were more severe than initially anticipated. This, coupled with lower than expected iPhone upgrades, resulted in a decline in revenue in Greater China by $4.8 billion year-on-year. Most of the worldwide revenue decline was driven by performance in Greater China. 

However, Apple experienced growth outside of China, with record performances in markets such as the Americas, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, and the rest of Asia Pacific. Services revenue set an all-time record, reaching $10.9 billion in the quarter. The company saw strong results from its wearables business, with revenues up over 50%. Apple also achieved record revenue in its Mac and iPad categories.

The decline in iPhone revenue was attributed to several factors, including the relative strength of the US dollar which made Apple's products more expensive in many parts of the world, decreasing subsidies for iPhone purchases in Japan due to local regulations, and the availability of a battery replacement program which encouraged customers to hold onto their existing iPhones for longer. Despite the decline in iPhone revenue, Apple's business grew strongly outside of this category.

Apple highlighted its strong customer satisfaction and loyalty, as well as its large and growing active installed base, as key drivers of its success. The company emphasized its deep culture of innovation and its talented team in creating hardware, software, and services to deliver an unparalleled user experience.

Looking ahead, Apple expressed confidence in the fundamental strength of its business and mentioned exciting announcements to come later in the year. The company will continue to invest through near-term headwinds and expects to emerge stronger as a result.",gpt-3

Key Highlights:
- The active installed base of Apple devices reached 1.3 billion devices, representing a 30% growth in just two years.
- iPhone X was the best-selling smartphone in the world and was the top-selling phone every week since its launch. The newly launched iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus also performed well, driving total revenue above the guidance range.
- Services revenue reached $8.5 billion, up 18% year over year and on track to achieve the goal of doubling 2016 revenue by 2020. The number of paid subscriptions across Services offerings exceeded 240 million, with significant growth in App Store revenue and the release of ARKit-enabled apps.
- Apple Watch had its best quarter ever, with over 50% growth in revenue and units sold for the fourth consecutive quarter. It is now the most popular smartwatch in the world.
- iPad revenue experienced its third consecutive quarter of growth, driven by the strength of the iPad and iPad Pro. Apple gained market share in nearly every market it tracks and saw significant sales to first-time tablet buyers and switchers.
- Mac sales increased by 2% year over year, with strong performance in emerging markets and a double-digit growth in active installed base.
- Apple's cash position reached $285.1 billion, with a sequential increase of $16.2 billion. The company issued $7 billion in debt, bringing their total net cash position to $163 billion.

Qualitative insights:
- Apple's strong performance can be attributed to its diverse product portfolio and the continued success of the iPhone, Services, Apple Watch, and iPad.
- The company's commitment to innovation, such as the introduction of ARKit and the ongoing investment in new initiatives like Everyone Can Code, has fueled growth in Services revenue and customer engagement.
- Customer satisfaction remains high across all product categories, with strong interest and loyalty towards the iPhone.
- Apple continues to expand its retail store presence and is actively investing in initiatives to strengthen its enterprise offerings.

Apple's 2Q18 revenue guidance is in the range of $60-62 billion, which indicates a potential decrease compared to the record-breaking revenue achieved in Q1 2018. The guidance takes into account the seasonality of Apple's product cycle and the 13-week duration of the quarter, compared to 14 weeks in the previous year. The company remains optimistic about its future performance in all geographic segments and expects double-digit revenue growth to continue.",gpt-3

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good day, and welcome to the Apple Inc. Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR and Treasury    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.
For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I just got back from Brooklyn, where we marked our fourth major launch at the end of the year. In addition to being a great time, it put an exclamation point at the end of a remarkable fiscal 2018.
This year, we shipped our 2 billionth iOS device, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the App Store and achieved the strongest revenue and earnings in Apple's history. In fiscal year '18, our revenue grew by $36.4 billion. That's the equivalent of a Fortune 100 company in a single year. And we're capping all that off with our best September quarter ever.
Revenue was $62.9 billion, ahead of our expectations. That's an increase of 20% over last year and our highest growth rate in 3 years. We also generated record Q4 earnings with 41% year-over-year growth in EPS. Record results from iPhone, Services and Wearables drove our momentum, and we produced strong double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographic segments.
It was a big year and a big quarter for iPhone. Q4 revenue was up 29% over last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new September quarter record, fueled by continued momentum for iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X and the very successful launch of iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max. These latest devices are our most advanced iPhones ever with the industry's first 7-nanometer A12 Bionic chip with an Apple-designed 8-core Neural Engine capable of executing an astounding 5 trillion operations per second.
The A12 Bionic is many years in the making and a huge technological leap forward. It sets the iPhone experience far apart from the competition using real-time machine learning to transform the way we experience photo, gaming, augmented reality and more. It makes full use of the dual-camera system that shoots portrait mode photos with Smart HDR and dynamic depth of field, and Face ID is even faster.
The response has been powerful. As one reviewer put it, ""iPhone Xs and Xs Max are the perfect blend of design and craftsmanship as well as seamlessly intuitive user experience."" We're not done yet. Just last week, we began shipping iPhone XR, bringing the latest iPhone breakthroughs to even more users. With an all-screen glass and aluminum design and the most advanced LCD in a smartphone, the product reviews had been overwhelmingly positive.
iOS 12 has gotten off to an incredible start. It's been installed on more systems in its first month than any version of iOS ever. iOS 12 is delivering system-wide performance enhancements, Siri Shortcuts and new tools to help people reduce interruption and manage screen time for themselves and their kids.
Siri Shortcuts, in particular, is already deeply integrated with some of the most popular apps out there. Whether you're tracking your workouts or rushing to catch a flight, you can be sure all of your most relevant apps are working together with Siri in the driver seat.
iOS 12 also features ARKit 2, a major upgrade to our augmented reality engine. ARKit 2 makes possible simultaneous multi-user experiences and real-world object incorporation. Our developer community is really running with this technology. From gaming to shopping, we're seeing great new use cases emerge. iOS devices deliver the best AR experiences of any products in the market today, and with the announcement of our new iPad Pro this week, we've made that gap even wider.
More powerful than the vast majority of PC laptops, the new iPad Pro is unrivaled in its versatility and performance. And paired with the beautifully refined Apple Pencil and a new streamlined full-size smart keyboard, iPad Pro will extend its lead as the ultimate creativity and productivity device. And finally, just this week, we delivered the hotly anticipated group FaceTime functionality to all FaceTime-enabled devices.
For Services, it was our best quarter ever with revenue at $10 billion. Excluding the impact of a favorable onetime accounting adjustment of $640 million a year ago, our Services growth was 27%.
We set new Q4 records in all of our geographic segments and new all-time revenue records for the App Store, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Music and Apple Pay. We also continued to see strong growth in paid subscriptions, reaching over 330 million in our ecosystem.
I want to spotlight the exceptional performance of Apple Pay, which is, by far, the #1 mobile contactless payment service worldwide. Transaction volume tripled year-over-year, and to put that into perspective, Apple Pay generated significantly more transactions than even PayPal mobile with over 4x the growth rate.
As a testament to accelerating U.S. growth, Costco completed the rollout of Apple Pay to over 500 U.S. warehouses last quarter, while Neiman Marcus is now accepting Apple Pay at over 40 stores across the country. With these additions, 71 of the top 100 merchants and 60% of all U.S. retail locations support Apple Pay.
We continue to invest in our strategy to replace the wallet with the recent launch of student ID passes at several major U.S. universities. And 10 months following its launch, Apple Pay Cash is the highest-rated mobile peer-to-peer service by Consumer Reports based on exceptional payment authentication and data privacy.
We set an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue, thanks to strong performance in MacBook Pro and the impact of the back-to-school season. In September, we delivered macOS Mojave, bringing powerful new features to Mac like dark mode, stack and a completely redesigned Mac App Store. Considered alongside the release of iOS 12, watchOS 5 and a new tvOS, macOS Mojave tells a powerful story of the seamless integration of world-class hardware, software and services that define the Apple ecosystem.
As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, earlier this week, we announced exciting updates to the Mac lineup. The all-new MacBook Air brings a stunning Retina display, Touch ID, the latest processors and an even more portable design to the world's most beloved notebook. We also unveiled the biggest update ever to Mac mini, the small yet muscular desktop that powers everything from the music and sound effects of Broadway shows to the developers who build some of the most popular apps in the App Store. The new Mac mini boasts an amazing 5x faster performance than before.
With revenue growth over 50%, it was another record quarter for Wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products. With the highest customer satisfaction in the industry, Apple Watch has become an essential part of people's lives. The customer response to the Apple Watch Series 4 has been overwhelmingly positive, driven by its all-new design, larger display, faster performance, fall detection, enhanced cellular reception and electrical heart sensor.
Later this year, the ECG app will be available to Apple Watch Series 4 customers in the U.S., giving them the ability to take an electrocardiogram anytime right from their wrists. And for U.S. customers with Apple Watch Series 1 and later, watchOS will soon enable periodic checks for irregular heart rhythms that may be suggestive of AFib. These are unprecedented and potentially life changing features, showing how Apple Watch is not only an indispensable communication and fitness companion but also an intelligent guardian for your health. More broadly, we see this as just one further example of the kind of contribution we can make in the health space, and we look forward to making more in the future.
We are proud to bring HomePod to new customers. I was in Spain last week as HomePod became available there and in Mexico. HomePod delivers the highest fidelity audio quality, working together with an Apple Music subscription to stream over 50 million songs into any room in your home.
Our retail team posted record Q4 results to conclude their biggest year ever. They are transforming our stores into places where customers come to connect, learn and be inspired together with people from their community. Our Today at Apple sessions are a terrific example of what that looks like in practice. We hosted over 250,000 Today at Apple sessions this quarter, connecting aspiring creators with local photographers, illustrators and other experts who can help them get the most out of their devices. Apple Stores also hosted 74,000 kids at Apple Camp.
The relationship Apple has with our customers is about more than just making a purchase. With the recent addition of beautiful new stores in Italy, Japan, China and in just a few weeks, Thailand, we will have 506 stores where we can further those relationships, almost half of which are outside United States.
Before I turn the call over to Luca, I'd like to touch on 2 items that may not show up in our financial statement but are just as integral to Apple's mission and our commitment to making the world a better place. 
First, education. More than 5,000 schools, community colleges and technical colleges worldwide are now using Everyone Can Code, our free coding curriculum. Ideas, creativity and passion for technology's potential aren't limited by ZIP code or country, and we don't think opportunity should be either. We're also excited that educators in more than 350 schools around the world have started working with Everyone Can Create, the free collection of tools and project guides we introduced this spring designed to help unleash kids' creativity throughout their school day with the help of iPad.
Next is the environment. This was a milestone year for Apple's commitment to our planet. In April, we announced that 100% of our global operations are powered by renewable energy. We also made progress in doing the same in our supply chain. And just this week, we announced that the enclosures of new products like MacBook Air and iPad Pro will be made from 100% recycled aluminum, a strong, durable and beautiful new alloy designed by Apple.
This is a great example of how a commitment to do right on the issues that matter can drive once unimaginable innovation, new ways of approaching old problems and beautiful solutions that set us apart. I'd like to thank all of our employees, customers, developers and business partners for helping us deliver outstanding results across our fiscal 2018. We are headed into the holidays with our strongest product lineup ever, and we could not be more bullish about Apple's future.
And now Luca has more details to share with you on the September quarter. Luca?

Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely pleased to report record results for our September quarter, which capped a tremendously successful fiscal 2018, a year in which we saw double-digit revenue growth in every geographic segment and established new revenue and earnings records in every single quarter.
Revenue in the fourth quarter was $62.9 billion, up 20% and more than $10 billion over last year with strong double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments and record Q4 revenue in the Americas, in Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. In fact, we set new revenue records in almost every market we track with especially strong growth in Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan and Korea, all major markets where revenue growth was 25% or higher. We also set new fourth quarter revenue records for iPhone and Wearables and new all-time records for Services and Mac.
Gross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially in line with our expectations as leverage from higher revenue offset seasonal transition costs. We set new September quarter records for net income, EPS and cash flo

With an all-screen glass and aluminum design and the most advanced LCD in a smartphone, the product reviews had been overwhelmingly positive.\niOS 12 has gotten off to an incredible start. It\'s been installed on more systems in its first month than any version of iOS ever. iOS 12 is delivering system-wide performance enhancements, Siri Shortcuts and new tools to help people reduce interruption and manage screen time for themselves and their kids.\nSiri Shortcuts, in particular, is already deeply integrated with some of the most popular apps out there. Whether you\'re tracking your workouts or rushing to catch a flight, you can be sure all of your most relevant apps are working together with Siri in the driver seat.\niOS 12 also features ARKit 2, a major upgrade to our augmented reality engine. ARKit 2 makes possible simultaneous multi-user experiences and real-world object incorporation. Our developer community is really running with this technology. From gaming to shopping, we\'re seeing great new use cases emerge. iOS devices deliver the best AR experiences of any products in the market today, and with the announcement of our new iPad Pro this week, we\'ve made that gap even wider.\nMore powerful than the vast majority of PC laptops, the new iPad Pro is unrivaled in its versatility and performance. And paired with the beautifully refined Apple Pencil and a new streamlined full-size smart keyboard, iPad Pro will extend its lead as the ultimate creativity and productivity device. And finally, just this week, we delivered the hotly anticipated group FaceTime functionality to all FaceTime-enabled devices.\nFor Services, it was our best quarter ever with revenue at $10 billion. Excluding the impact of a favorable onetime accounting adjustment of $640 million a year ago, our Services growth was 27%.\nWe set new Q4 records in all of our geographic segments and new all-time revenue records for the App Store, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Music and Apple Pay. We also continued to see strong growth in paid subscriptions, reaching over 330 million in our ecosystem.\nI want to spotlight the exceptional performance of Apple Pay, which is, by far, the #1 mobile contactless payment service worldwide. Transaction volume tripled year-over-year, and to put that into perspective, Apple Pay generated significantly more transactions than even PayPal mobile with over 4x the growth rate.\nAs a testament to accelerating U.S. growth, Costco completed the rollout of Apple Pay to over 500 U.S. warehouses last quarter, while Neiman Marcus is now accepting Apple Pay at over 40 stores across the country. With these additions, 71 of the top 100 merchants and 60% of all U.S. retail locations support Apple Pay.\nWe continue to invest in our strategy to replace the wallet with the recent launch of student ID passes at several major U.S. universities. And 10 months following its launch, Apple Pay Cash is the highest-rated mobile peer-to-peer service by Consumer Reports based on exceptional payment authentication and data privacy.\nWe set an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue, thanks to strong performance in MacBook Pro and the impact of the back-to-school season. In September, we delivered macOS Mojave, bringing powerful new features to Mac like dark mode, stack and a completely redesigned Mac App Store. Considered alongside the release of iOS 12, watchOS 5 and a new tvOS, macOS Mojave tells a powerful story of the seamless integration of world-class hardware, software and services that define the Apple ecosystem.\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of the call, earlier this week, we announced exciting updates to the Mac lineup. The all-new MacBook Air brings a stunning Retina display, Touch ID, the latest processors and an even more portable design to the world\'s most beloved notebook. We also unveiled the biggest update ever to Mac mini, the small yet muscular desktop that powers everything from the music and sound effects of Broadway shows to the developers who build some of the most popular apps in the App Store. The new Mac mini boasts an amazing 5x faster performance than before.\nWith revenue growth over 50%, it was another record quarter for Wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products. With the highest customer satisfaction in the industry, Apple Watch has become an essential part of people\'s lives. The customer response to the Apple Watch Series 4 has been overwhelmingly positive, driven by its all-new design, larger display, faster performance, fall detection, enhanced cellular reception and electrical heart sensor.\nLater this year, the ECG app will be available to Apple Watch Series 4 customers in the U.S., giving them the ability to take an electrocardiogram anytime right from their wrists. And for U.S. customers with Apple Watch Series 1 and later, watchOS will soon enable periodic checks for irregular heart rhythms that may be suggestive of AFib. These are unprecedented and potentially life changing features, showing how Apple Watch is not only an indispensable communication and fitness companion but also an intelligent guardian for your health. More broadly, we see this as just one further example of the kind of contribution we can make in the health space, and we look forward to making more in the future.\nWe are proud to bring HomePod to new customers. I was in Spain last week as HomePod became available there and in Mexico. HomePod delivers the highest fidelity audio quality, working together with an Apple Music subscription to stream over 50 million songs into any room in your home.\nOur retail team posted record Q4 results to conclude their biggest year ever. They are transforming our stores into places where customers come to connect, learn and be inspired together with people from their community. Our Today at Apple sessions are a terrific example of what that looks like in practice. We hosted over 250,000 Today at Apple sessions this quarter, connecting aspiring creators with local photographers, illustrators and other experts who can help them get the most out of their devices. Apple Stores also hosted 74,000 kids at Apple Camp.\nThe relationship Apple has with our customers is about more than just making a purchase. With the recent addition of beautiful new stores in Italy, Japan, China and in just a few weeks, Thailand, we will have 506 stores where we can further those relationships, almost half of which are outside United States.\nBefore I turn the call over to Luca, I\'d like to touch on 2 items that may not show up in our financial statement but are just as integral to Apple\'s mission and our commitment to making the world a better place. \nFirst, education. More than 5,000 schools, community colleges and technical colleges worldwide are now using Everyone Can Code, our free coding curriculum. Ideas, creativity and passion for technology\'s potential aren\'t limited by ZIP code or country, and we don\'t think opportunity should be either. We\'re also excited that educators in more than 350 schools around the world have started working with Everyone Can Create, the free collection of tools and project guides we introduced this spring designed to help unleash kids\' creativity throughout their school day with the help of iPad.\nNext is the environment. This was a milestone year for Apple\'s commitment to our planet. In April, we announced that 100% of our global operations are powered by renewable energy. We also made progress in doing the same in our supply chain. And just this week, we announced that the enclosures of new products like MacBook Air and iPad Pro will be made from 100% recycled aluminum, a strong, durable and beautiful new alloy designed by Apple.\nThis is a great example of how a commitment to do right on the issues that matter can drive once unimaginable innovation, new ways of approaching old problems and beautiful solutions that set us apart. I\'d like to thank all of our employees, customers, developers and business partners for helping us deliver outstanding results across our fiscal 2018. We are headed into the holidays with our strongest product lineup ever, and we could not be more bullish about Apple\'s future.\nAnd now Luca has more details to share with you on the September quarter. Luca?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLuca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely pleased to report record results for our September quarter, which capped a tremendously successful fiscal 2018, a year in which we saw double-digit revenue growth in every geographic segment and established new revenue and earnings records in every single quarter.\nRevenue in the fourth quarter was $62.9 billion, up 20% and more than $10 billion over last year with strong double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments and record Q4 revenue in the Americas, in Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. In fact, we set new revenue records in almost every market we track with especially strong growth in Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan and Korea, all major markets where revenue growth was 25% or higher. We also set new fourth quarter revenue records for iPhone and Wearables and new all-time records for Services and Mac.\nGross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially in line with our expectations as leverage from higher revenue offset seasonal transition costs. We set new September quarter records for net income, EPS and cash flo'}","In the Q4 2018 Apple Inc. earnings call, the company reports a record-breaking quarter and fiscal year, touting significant growth across revenue, earnings, and product sectors.

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good day, and welcome to the Apple Inc. Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR and Treasury    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.
For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I just got back from Brooklyn, where we marked our fourth major launch at the end of the year. In addition to being a great time, it put an exclamation point at the end of a remarkable fiscal 2018.
This year, we shipped our 2 billionth iOS device, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the App Store and achieved the strongest revenue and earnings in Apple's history. In fiscal year '18, our revenue grew by $36.4 billion. That's the equivalent of a Fortune 100 company in a single year. And we're capping all that off with our best September quarter ever.
Revenue was $62.9 billion, ahead of our expectations. That's an increase of 20% over last year and our highest growth rate in 3 years. We also generated record Q4 earnings with 41% year-over-year growth in EPS. Record results from iPhone, Services and Wearables drove our momentum, and we produced strong double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographic segments.
It was a big year and a big quarter for iPhone. Q4 revenue was up 29% over last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new September quarter record, fueled by continued momentum for iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X and the very successful launch of iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max. These latest devices are our most advanced iPhones ever with the industry's first 7-nanometer A12 Bionic chip with an Apple-designed 8-core Neural Engine capable of executing an astounding 5 trillion operations per second.
The A12 Bionic is many years in the making and a huge technological leap forward. It sets the iPhone experience far apart from the competition using real-time machine learning to transform the way we experience photo, gaming, augmented reality and more. It makes full use of the dual-camera system that shoots portrait mode photos with Smart HDR and dynamic depth of field, and Face ID is even faster.
The response has been powerful. As one reviewer put it, ""iPhone Xs and Xs Max are the perfect blend of design and craftsmanship as well as seamlessly intuitive user experience."" We're not done yet. Just last week, we began shipping iPhone XR, bringing the latest iPhone breakthroughs to even more users. With an all-screen glass and aluminum design and the most advanced LCD in a smartphone, the product reviews had been overwhelmingly positive.
iOS 12 has gotten off to an incredible start. It's been installed on more systems in its first month than any version of iOS ever. iOS 12 is delivering system-wide performance enhancements, Siri Shortcuts and new tools to help people reduce interruption and manage screen time for themselves and their kids.
Siri Shortcuts, in particular, is already deeply integrated with some of the most popular apps out there. Whether you're tracking your workouts or rushing to catch a flight, you can be sure all of your most relevant apps are working together with Siri in the driver seat.
iOS 12 also features ARKit 2, a major upgrade to our augmented reality engine. ARKit 2 makes possible simultaneous multi-user experiences and real-world object incorporation. Our developer community is really running with this technology. From gaming to shopping, we're seeing great new use cases emerge. iOS devices deliver the best AR experiences of any products in the market today, and with the announcement of our new iPad Pro this week, we've made that gap even wider.
More powerful than the vast majority of PC laptops, the new iPad Pro is unrivaled in its versatility and performance. And paired with the beautifully refined Apple Pencil and a new streamlined full-size smart keyboard, iPad Pro will extend its lead as the ultimate creativity and productivity device. And finally, just this week, we delivered the hotly anticipated group FaceTime functionality to all FaceTime-enabled devices.
For Services, it was our best quarter ever with revenue at $10 billion. Excluding the impact of a favorable onetime accounting adjustment of $640 million a year ago, our Services growth was 27%.
We set new Q4 records in all of our geographic segments and new all-time revenue records for the App Store, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Music and Apple Pay. We also continued to see strong growth in paid subscriptions, reaching over 330 million in our ecosystem.
I want to spotlight the exceptional performance of Apple Pay, which is, by far, the #1 mobile contactless payment service worldwide. Transaction volume tripled year-over-year, and to put that into perspective, Apple Pay generated significantly more transactions than even PayPal mobile with over 4x the growth rate.
As a testament to accelerating U.S. growth, Costco completed the rollout of Apple Pay to over 500 U.S. warehouses last quarter, while Neiman Marcus is now accepting Apple Pay at over 40 stores across the country. With these additions, 71 of the top 100 merchants and 60% of all U.S. retail locations support Apple Pay.
We continue to invest in our strategy to replace the wallet with the recent launch of student ID passes at several major U.S. universities. And 10 months following its launch, Apple Pay Cash is the highest-rated mobile peer-to-peer service by Consumer Reports based on exceptional payment authentication and data privacy.

With these additions, 71 of the top 100 merchants and 60% of all U.S. retail locations support Apple Pay.\nWe continue to invest in our strategy to replace the wallet with the recent launch of student ID passes at several major U.S. universities. And 10 months following its launch, Apple Pay Cash is the highest-rated mobile peer-to-peer service by Consumer Reports based on exceptional payment authentication and data privacy.\nWe set an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue, thanks to strong performance in MacBook Pro and the impact of the back-to-school season. In September, we delivered macOS Mojave, bringing powerful new features to Mac like dark mode, stack and a completely redesigned Mac App Store. Considered alongside the release of iOS 12, watchOS 5 and a new tvOS, macOS Mojave tells a powerful story of the seamless integration of world-class hardware, software and services that define the Apple ecosystem.\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of the call, earlier this week, we announced exciting updates to the Mac lineup. The all-new MacBook Air brings a stunning Retina display, Touch ID, the latest processors and an even more portable design to the world\'s most beloved notebook. We also unveiled the biggest update ever to Mac mini, the small yet muscular desktop that powers everything from the music and sound effects of Broadway shows to the developers who build some of the most popular apps in the App Store. The new Mac mini boasts an amazing 5x faster performance than before.\nWith revenue growth over 50%, it was another record quarter for Wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products. With the highest customer satisfaction in the industry, Apple Watch has become an essential part of people\'s lives. The customer response to the Apple Watch Series 4 has been overwhelmingly positive, driven by its all-new design, larger display, faster performance, fall detection, enhanced cellular reception and electrical heart sensor.\nLater this year, the ECG app will be available to Apple Watch Series 4 customers in the U.S., giving them the ability to take an electrocardiogram anytime right from their wrists. And for U.S. customers with Apple Watch Series 1 and later, watchOS will soon enable periodic checks for irregular heart rhythms that may be suggestive of AFib. These are unprecedented and potentially life changing features, showing how Apple Watch is not only an indispensable communication and fitness companion but also an intelligent guardian for your health. More broadly, we see this as just one further example of the kind of contribution we can make in the health space, and we look forward to making more in the future.\nWe are proud to bring HomePod to new customers. I was in Spain last week as HomePod became available there and in Mexico. HomePod delivers the highest fidelity audio quality, working together with an Apple Music subscription to stream over 50 million songs into any room in your home.\nOur retail team posted record Q4 results to conclude their biggest year ever. They are transforming our stores into places where customers come to connect, learn and be inspired together with people from their community. Our Today at Apple sessions are a terrific example of what that looks like in practice. We hosted over 250,000 Today at Apple sessions this quarter, connecting aspiring creators with local photographers, illustrators and other experts who can help them get the most out of their devices. Apple Stores also hosted 74,000 kids at Apple Camp.\nThe relationship Apple has with our customers is about more than just making a purchase. With the recent addition of beautiful new stores in Italy, Japan, China and in just a few weeks, Thailand, we will have 506 stores where we can further those relationships, almost half of which are outside United States.\nBefore I turn the call over to Luca, I\'d like to touch on 2 items that may not show up in our financial statement but are just as integral to Apple\'s mission and our commitment to making the world a better place. \nFirst, education. More than 5,000 schools, community colleges and technical colleges worldwide are now using Everyone Can Code, our free coding curriculum. Ideas, creativity and passion for technology\'s potential aren\'t limited by ZIP code or country, and we don\'t think opportunity should be either. We\'re also excited that educators in more than 350 schools around the world have started working with Everyone Can Create, the free collection of tools and project guides we introduced this spring designed to help unleash kids\' creativity throughout their school day with the help of iPad.\nNext is the environment. This was a milestone year for Apple\'s commitment to our planet. In April, we announced that 100% of our global operations are powered by renewable energy. We also made progress in doing the same in our supply chain. And just this week, we announced that the enclosures of new products like MacBook Air and iPad Pro will be made from 100% recycled aluminum, a strong, durable and beautiful new alloy designed by Apple.\nThis is a great example of how a commitment to do right on the issues that matter can drive once unimaginable innovation, new ways of approaching old problems and beautiful solutions that set us apart. I\'d like to thank all of our employees, customers, developers and business partners for helping us deliver outstanding results across our fiscal 2018. We are headed into the holidays with our strongest product lineup ever, and we could not be more bullish about Apple\'s future.\nAnd now Luca has more details to share with you on the September quarter. Luca?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLuca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely pleased to report record results for our September quarter, which capped a tremendously successful fiscal 2018, a year in which we saw double-digit revenue growth in every geographic segment and established new revenue and earnings records in every single quarter.\nRevenue in the fourth quarter was $62.9 billion, up 20% and more than $10 billion over last year with strong double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments and record Q4 revenue in the Americas, in Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. In fact, we set new revenue records in almost every market we track with especially strong growth in Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan and Korea, all major markets where revenue growth was 25% or higher. We also set new fourth quarter revenue records for iPhone and Wearables and new all-time records for Services and Mac.\nGross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially in line with our expectations as leverage from higher revenue offset seasonal transition costs. We set new September quarter records for net income, EPS and cash flo'}","Apple Inc. reported record results for its Q4 2018, marking a successful fiscal year with double-digit revenue growth in all geographic segments. The company achieved its highest revenue and earnings in history, with revenue growing by $36.4 billion in fiscal year '18. Q4 revenue reached $62.9 billion, a 20% increase from the previous year and the highest growth rate in 3 years.

Key drivers of revenue growth included strong performance in iPhone, Services, and Wearables. iPhone revenue was up 29% from last year, driven by the success of iPhone 8, 8 Plus, X, Xs, and Xs Max. The latest iPhones feature the industry's first 7-nanometer A12 Bionic chip, which uses real-time machine learning to enhance user experience in areas such as photography, gaming, and augmented reality.

Services revenue reached $10 billion, the best quarter ever for this segment. Apple Pay, in particular, saw significant growth, generating more transactions than PayPal mobile, with triple the growth rate. The company continues to invest in its strategy to replace the wallet, expanding Apple Pay acceptance to 71 of the top 100 merchants and 60% of all U.S. retail locations.

Mac revenue reached an all-time quarterly record, driven by strong performance in MacBook Pro and the back-to-school season. The release of macOS Mojave, iOS 12, watchOS 5, and a new tvOS showcased the seamless integration of Apple's hardware, software, and services.

Wearables, which include Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats products, had another record quarter with revenue growth over 50%. Apple Watch Series 4 received positive customer response, highlighting features such as fall detection, enhanced cellular reception, and an electrical heart sensor. Apple plans to introduce an ECG app and irregular heart rhythm checks to further enhance the health benefits of its wearable devices.

Apple's retail team posted record Q4 results, transforming Apple Stores into community hubs where customers can connect, learn, and be inspired. Today at Apple sessions and Apple Camps are examples of initiatives that promote creativity and cultivate relationships.

In addition to financial performance, Apple highlighted its commitment to education and the environment. Over 5,000 schools worldwide are using Apple's free coding curriculum, Everyone Can Code, and more than 350 schools are utilizing Everyone Can Create, a collection of tools and project guides.

Apple's global operations are powered by renewable energy, and products like MacBook Air and iPad Pro now use 100% recycled aluminum enclosures. The company sees these commitments as driving innovation, solving real-world problems, and making a positive contribution to society.

Overall, Apple's strong financial performance, innovative product lineup, and commitment to education and the environment position the company for a promising future.",gpt-3

I. 2Q20 Review (T.C.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1. Overview:
          1. Revenue $58.3b.
               1. All-time record for Services.
               2. Quarterly record for Wearables, Home and Accessories.
               3. Quarterly revenue record for Retail, powered by growth in online store.
          2. Amid the most challenging global environment in which Co. has ever operated its business, AAPL grew during qtr.
     2. COVID-19 Response:
          1. Contending with COVID-19 since Jan.
          2. Before COVID-19 was on the horizon, Co. anticipated that 2Q20 was going to be prolific and energetic period for AAPL.
               1. When pandemic did strike, teams succeeded in growing the business in introducing powerful new products and in meeting customers' needs, and they rose to the occasion in terms of meeting broader obligations to communities.
          3. At the same time that they were leaving no stone unturned to get Co.'s latest generation of devices manufactured and into customers' hands, worldwide network of supply chain partners, logistics and operations folks in every part of AAPL were also sourcing more than 30m masks for frontline medical workers, ensuring they're donated to places of greatest need in every region worldwide.
          4. While product teams were preparing to launch new iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, MacBook Air and new iPhone SE, they were also working with suppliers to design, test, manufacture and distribute more than 7.5m face shields.
               1. Continues to ship more than 1m of these every week to doctors, nurses and medical personnel on frontlines.
          5. In a qtr. where Services teams achieved strong growth, which speaks to real durability of Services strategy, these teams were also putting COVID-19 front and center.
               1. As Apple News reached 125m monthly active users, Co. elevated trusted information from reliable sources through special COVID-19 vertical.
               2. Let customers skip payments without incurring interests on Apple Card for March and April in light of financial hardship for many families.
               3. Worked with everyone from Oprah to Lady Gaga, to inform, entertain and give back through Apple TV.
               4. Services like FaceTime and Messages set new all-time records for daily volume as users relied on their devices to stay connected in new reality.
          6. In software, at the same time that teams work with great creativity and excitement as Co. prepares to deliver first-ever all-online Worldwide Developers Conference later this qtr., they also worked with same creativity and speed to put together COVID-19 symptom checking website and app in partnership with CDC.
               1. As of 04/30/20, app has been installed nearly 2m times and web tool has received over 3m unique visits.
               2. This month, to accelerate contact tracing, launching joint effort with Google to enable to use of Bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of virus with user privacy and security central to design.
          7. Paired aforementioned programmatic efforts with broader strategy to give back where it's needed most.
               1. Made major corporate donations to response efforts worldwide to support global citizen, and new fund for Americans experiencing food and security due to crisis.
                    1. When tallying these things up and considering ongoing two-to-one match for employee donations, Co.'s contributions to global response are significant, diverse and great source of pride for whole team.
               2. Doing what Co. can to help employees, their families, and by extension, their communities, stay safe and well by modifying its operations where appropriate.
                    1. This extends to retail employees; they're Co.'s face to customers and instrumental part of business, and AAPL is compensating them normally despite store closures.
          8. During a qtr. where circumstances evolved by the hour, Co. has been gratified by resilience and adaptability of global supply chain.
               1. While Co. felt some temporary supply constraints in Feb., operations team, suppliers and manufacturing partners have been safely returning to work and production was back at typical levels toward March-end.
          9. At this time of social distance, of shuttered schools and gathering places, of delayed plans and new ways of socializing, Co. has seen significant evidence that AAPL's products have taken renewed importance for customers.
               1. Teachers and students worldwide are relying on Co.'s technology to teach, learn and stay connected with each other.
               2. Co. is in process of deploying major orders of iPads to school systems working to keep learning going strong at a distance, including:
                    1. Tens of thousands in Ontario, Canada, Glasgow, Scotland, and Puerto Rico.
                    2. 100,000 to city of Los Angeles.
                    3. 350,000 to New York City.
               3. Aforementioned is Co.'s largest educational iPad deployment ever.
               4. Since early March, seen unprecedented demand for Pro Apps from students, enthusiasts and creative professionals.
                    1. Made Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X available for free for 90 days for everyone.
                    2. Reaction has been overwhelming, driving software downloads and usage to record levels.
          10. Doctors and medical professionals are making even greater use of Apple Watch and other health features to communicate with patients and to treat them safely from distance when necessary.
               1. With new FDA guidance on non-invasive remote patient monitoring, ECG app on Apple Watch is increasingly being used to facilitate remote ECG measurements and recordings for telemedicine usage, reducing patient and healthcare provider contact and exposure.
               2. Many hospitals like Geisinger Health System, NYU Langone Health and Stanford Health Care are using apps on iPad and iPhone to support communication and video conferences between hospitalized patients and their care teams.
                    1. This enables care teams to keep close watch on patients without entering isolation rooms, which helps to minimize exposure and reduces some of the need for personal protective equipment.
     3. Key Metrics:
          1. Revenue $58.3b.
               1. Product revenue $45b.
          2. Performance of product business had three very different phases.
               1. Based on Co.'s performance during first five weeks of qtr., AAPL was confident it was headed toward record 2Q at the very high end of expectations.
               2. In next five weeks of qtr., as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected, and demand for products within China.
                    1. This caused Co. to withdraw revenue guidance in Feb.
                    2. At that point, demand for products outside of China was still strong and in line with expectations.
               3. During last three weeks of qtr., as virus spread globally and social distancing measures were put in place worldwide, including closure of all Co.'s retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13 and many channel partner points of sales worldwide, saw downward pressure on demand, particularly for iPhone and Wearables.
          3. Given lack of visibility and certainty in near term, will not be issuing guidance for coming qtr.
               1. Over long term, has high degree of confidence in enduring strength of business.
               2. Global supply chain is profoundly durable and resilient.
                    1. Shown consistent ability to meet and manage temporary supply challenges like those caused by COVID-19.
          4. Continued to deliver innovative new products across multiple categories that appeal to a broad cross section of customers, including all-new iPhone SE.
               1. Teams worldwide have tackled complexities of this moment with unmatched creativity, good humor and dedication to customers.
          5. Long running investment in Services strategy is succeeding.
               1. This business is growing, and is a reflection of Co.'s enduring large and growing installed base.
               2. Expects to meet longstanding goal of doubling FY16 Services revenue in 2020.
          6. Always run Co. for long term.
               1. Entered this period with unmatched financial strength, robust cash position and best product pipeline ever.
          7. Major investments, including five-year commitment to contribute $350b to economy in US are moving forward at full speed ahead.
          8. Always managed through difficult moments by doubling down and investing in next-generation of innovation, and that's Co.'s strategy today.

During a qtr. where circumstances evolved by the hour, Co. has been gratified by resilience and adaptability of global supply chain.\n               1. While Co. felt some temporary supply constraints in Feb., operations team, suppliers and manufacturing partners have been safely returning to work and production was back at typical levels toward March-end.\n          9. At this time of social distance, of shuttered schools and gathering places, of delayed plans and new ways of socializing, Co. has seen significant evidence that AAPL's products have taken renewed importance for customers.\n               1. Teachers and students worldwide are relying on Co.'s technology to teach, learn and stay connected with each other.\n               2. Co. is in process of deploying major orders of iPads to school systems working to keep learning going strong at a distance, including:\n                    1. Tens of thousands in Ontario, Canada, Glasgow, Scotland, and Puerto Rico.\n                    2. 100,000 to city of Los Angeles.\n                    3. 350,000 to New York City.\n               3.

Reaction has been overwhelming, driving software downloads and usage to record levels.\n          10. Doctors and medical professionals are making even greater use of Apple Watch and other health features to communicate with patients and to treat them safely from distance when necessary.\n               1. With new FDA guidance on non-invasive remote patient monitoring, ECG app on Apple Watch is increasingly being used to facilitate remote ECG measurements and recordings for telemedicine usage, reducing patient and healthcare provider contact and exposure.\n               2. Many hospitals like Geisinger Health System, NYU Langone Health and Stanford Health Care are using apps on iPad and iPhone to support communication and video conferences between hospitalized patients and their care teams.\n                    1. This enables care teams to keep close watch on patients without entering isolation rooms, which helps to minimize exposure and reduces some of the need for personal protective equipment.\n     3. Key Metrics:\n          1. Revenue $58.3b.\n               1. Product revenue $45b.\n          2. Performance of product business had three very different phases.\n               1. Based on Co.'s performance during first five weeks of qtr., AAPL was confident it was headed toward record 2Q at the very high end of expectations.\n               2. In next five weeks of qtr., as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected, and demand for products within China.\n                    1. This caused Co. to withdraw revenue guidance in Feb.\n                    2. At that point, demand for products outside of China was still strong and in line with expectations.\n               3. During last three weeks of qtr., as virus spread globally and social distancing measures were put in place worldwide, including closure of all Co.'s retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13 and many channel partner points of sales worldwide, saw downward pressure on demand, particularly for iPhone and Wearables.\n          3. Given lack of visibility and certainty in near term, will not be issuing guidance for coming qtr.\n               1. Over long term, has high degree of confidence in enduring strength of business.\n               2. Global supply chain is profoundly durable and resilient.\n                    1. Shown consistent ability to meet and manage temporary supply challenges like those caused by COVID-19.\n          4. Continued to deliver innovative new products across multiple categories that appeal to a broad cross section of customers, including all-new iPhone SE.\n               1. Teams worldwide have tackled complexities of this moment with unmatched creativity, good humor and dedication to customers.\n          5. Long running investment in Services strategy is succeeding.\n               1. This business is growing, and is a reflection of Co.'s enduring large and growing installed base.\n               2. Expects to meet longstanding goal of doubling FY16 Services revenue in 2020.\n          6. Always run Co. for long term.\n               1. Entered this period with unmatched financial strength, robust cash position and best product pipeline ever.\n          7. Major investments, including five-year commitment to contribute $350b to economy in US are moving forward at full speed ahead.\n          8. Always managed through difficult moments by doubling down and investing in next-generation of innovation, and that's Co.'s strategy today.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nII. 2Q20 Financials (L.M.)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     1.

Despite the challenging global environment due to COVID-19, Apple experienced a 1% year-over-year revenue growth. Gross margin (GM) stood at 38.4% for the quarter.

Apple's financial performance included:
- 2Q20 revenue of $58.3 billion.
- 2Q20 net income of $11.2 billion.
- 2Q20 EPS of $2.55.
- Revenue growth year-over-year at 1%.
- 2Q20 gross margin of 38.4%.
- Net cash position at the end of 2Q20 at $83 billion.
- Total debt at the end of 2Q20 at $110 billion.
- Share repurchase activity included 64.7 million AAPL shares for $18.5 billion through open market repurchases.

Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, presented a review of the quarter highlighting several aspects:
-The revenue was buttressed by an all-time high in Services as well as a quarterly revenue record for Wearables, Home, and Accessories and Retail. The Retail's strong performance was primarily attributed to growth in their online store.
-Although the COVID-19 pandemic posed an unforeseen challenge since January, Apple adapted quickly, continuing to grow during the quarter.
-During Q2, Apple's supply chain partners supplied over 30 million masks for frontline medical workers and produced over 7.5 million face shields, with over 1 million being shipped weekly.
-The company also adapted its services to focus on COVID-19 by providing credible information sources and financial reliefs, including Apple Card payment deferrals without incurring interest for March and April.
-Apple has deployed educational technology, including large iPad orders to several regions to support distance learning, with the largest-ever educational iPad deployment being for New York City (350,000).
-Record downloads and usage for Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X were observed following the company's offer of a free 90-day trial of these professional software applications.
-There was increased use of Apple Watch health features and remote patient monitoring apps, supported by newly issued FDA guidance on non-invasive remote patient monitoring.
-Apple is deeply invested in innovating for the long term, planning to meet its goal of doubling the fiscal year 2016 Services revenue in 2020, and continuing with their five-year commitment of $350 billion to the US economy.

Luca Maestri, Apple's CFO, provided details on the company's financials:
-The COVID-19 pandemic had an unexpected impact on the quarter's finances. A 1% revenue increase year-over-year to $58.3 billion was achieved, despite challenges from the virus and a 100 basis points (BP) foreign exchange (FX) headwind.
-Product revenues declined by 3% to $45 billion. Performance varied over the quarter with a strong start, then disruptions due to COVID-19 in China affecting both supply and demand, leading to the withdrawal of revenue guidance in February. The last three weeks of the quarter saw global spread of the virus and store closures, which decreased demand primarily for iPhone and Wearables.
-The gross margin was 38.4%, 30.3% for products (down 380 BP from previous period due to loss of leverage and unfavorable mix accentuated by the pandemic impact), and 65.4% for services (up 100 BP sequentially).
-iPhone revenue was $29 billion, a 7% decrease year-over-year, with supply shortages in February and varying demand due to COVID-19. However, the installed base of iPhones has hit an all-time high.
-Services revenue set an all-time record at $13.3 billion, with strong performance across various services, such as the App Store, Apple Music, video, cloud services, and App Store search ads.
-Apple postponed offering forward guidance due to uncertainty in the near term, but expressed confidence in the long-term strength of the business and supply chain resilience.

The company emphasized its adaptability to the challenges posed by COVID-19, the strategic importance of the Services division, the robustness of the supply chain, and continued customer and product engagement despite a complex global landscape. Apple highlighted its commitment to innovation and investment in the long term while executing significant corporate social responsibility initiatives during the pandemic.",gpt-4

                    1. Made Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X available for free for 90 days for everyone.

          10. Doctors and medical professionals are making even greater use of Apple Watch and other health features to communicate with patients and to treat them safely from distance when necessary.
               1. With new FDA guidance on non-invasive remote patient monitoring, ECG app on Apple Watch is increasingly being used to facilitate remote ECG measurements and recordings for telemedicine usage, reducing patient and healthcare provider contact and exposure.
               2. Many hospitals like Geisinger Health System, NYU Langone Health and Stanford Health Care are using apps on iPad and iPhone to support communication and video conferences between hospitalized patients and their care teams.
                    1. This enables care teams to keep close watch on patients without entering isolation rooms, which helps to minimize exposure and reduces some of the need for personal protective equipment.

               1. Product revenue $45b.

               1. Based on Co.'s performance during first five weeks of qtr., AAPL was confident it was headed toward record 2Q at the very high end of expectations.
               2. In next five weeks of qtr., as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected, and demand for products within China.
                    1. This caused Co. to withdraw revenue guidance in Feb.
                    2. At that point, demand for products outside of China was still strong and in line with expectations.
               3. During last three weeks of qtr., as virus spread globally and social distancing measures were put in place worldwide, including closure of all Co.'s retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13 and many channel partner points of sales worldwide, saw downward pressure on demand, particularly for iPhone and Wearables.
          3. Given lack of visibility and certainty in near term, will not be issuing guidance for coming qtr.
               1. Over long term, has high degree of confidence in enduring strength of business.
               2. Global supply chain is profoundly durable and resilient.
                    1. Shown consistent ability to meet and manage temporary supply challenges like those caused by COVID-19.
          4. Continued to deliver innovative new products across multiple categories that appeal to a broad cross section of customers, including all-new iPhone SE.
               1. Teams worldwide have tackled complexities of this moment with unmatched creativity, good humor and dedication to customers.
          5. Long running investment in Services strategy is succeeding.
               1. This business is growing, and is a reflection of Co.'s enduring large and growing installed base.
               2. Expects to meet longstanding goal of doubling FY16 Services revenue in 2020.
          6. Always run Co. for long term.
               1. Entered this period with unmatched financial strength, robust cash position and best product pipeline ever.
          7. Major investments, including five-year commitment to contribute $350b to economy in US are moving forward at full speed ahead.

During a qtr. where circumstances evolved by the hour, Co. has been gratified by resilience and adaptability of global supply chain.\n               1. While Co. felt some temporary supply constraints in Feb., operations team, suppliers and manufacturing partners have been safely returning to work and production was back at typical levels toward March-end.\n          9. At this time of social distance, of shuttered schools and gathering places, of delayed plans and new ways of socializing, Co. has seen significant evidence that AAPL's products have taken renewed importance for customers.\n               1. Teachers and students worldwide are relying on Co.'s technology to teach, learn and stay connected with each other.\n               2. Co. is in process of deploying major orders of iPads to school systems working to keep learning going strong at a distance, including:\n                    1.

The company achieved record revenue of $58.3 billion, with net income of $11.2 billion and earnings per share of $2.55. 

In terms of revenue drivers, Apple saw all-time record revenue in its Services segment, driven by strong growth in categories such as the App Store, Apple Music, Video, Cloud services, and App Store search ad business. The company's retail segment also achieved a quarterly revenue record, fueled by growth in the online store. 

However, the company faced challenges due to the impact of COVID-19. iPhone supply and demand were affected, particularly in China, during the last three weeks of the quarter, when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures became widespread. As a result, iPhone revenue saw a 7% year-over-year decline. Despite this, the active installed base of iPhones reached an all-time high, highlighting the quality of the products and the strength of the ecosystem. 

The company's services strategy continues to be successful, with year-over-year growth of 17% in the Services segment. Apple remains confident in its ability to double its services revenue from fiscal year 2016 by the end of 2020. 

In terms of financials, Apple's gross margin for the quarter was 38.4%, with flat sequential performance. The product gross margin was 30.3%, down 380 basis points sequentially due to loss of leverage and unfavorable mix caused by the impact of COVID-19. On the other hand, the services gross margin increased 100 basis points sequentially due to favorable mix. 

Apple did not provide guidance for the coming quarter due to the lack of visibility and certainty caused by the pandemic. However, the company expressed confidence in the long-term strength of its business and highlighted the resilience and adaptability of its global supply chain. 

Overall, Apple managed to navigate the challenging circumstances by introducing new products, supporting COVID-19 response efforts, and providing assistance to customers and communities. The company remains focused on its long-term strategy, including investments in innovation and its commitment to contribute $350 billion to the U.S. economy over five years.",gpt-3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Interim CEO, Executive VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Mark. And thanks to Navin and Murthy who will participate in the Q&A later in the call.
Before I get into the results, I'll take a minute to address what I expect is a top of mind question: the status of Intel's CEO search. The board continues to evaluate candidates for what I believe is the biggest and best open job on the planet. They are proceeding with a sense of urgency while also ensuring that they make the right choice for this great company.
Meanwhile, Murthy, Navin, the entire management team and 107,000 employees have come together as a team to continue driving Intel's transformation to a data-centric company. Our 2018 results demonstrate the progress we made, and I'd like to share those results with you now.
2018 marked Intel's golden anniversary. It was a truly remarkable year for a remarkable company. Full year revenue grew 13% and crossed the $70 billion mark for the first time, setting an all-time revenue record for the third consecutive year. Our data center, Internet of Things, Programmable Solutions, memory, Mobileye and modem businesses each set all-time full year revenue records.
2018 was also a pivotal year in Intel's transformation to become a data-centric company, pursuing an expanded greater-than-$300 billion market opportunity. Intel's collection of data-centric businesses grew 20% in 2018 after adjusting for McAfee. The largest of our data-centric businesses, the Data Center Group, delivered record annual revenue of $23 billion, up 21% year-over-year on strong cloud demand and growing share with communication service provider customers. Our PC-centric business achieved 9% growth in 2018 as the PC market stabilized, and we gained share in modems.
While 2018 was a record year, we expected a stronger finish. Fourth quarter revenue of $18.7 billion was up 9% but short of our expectations as a result of a dramatically weakening modem demand, lower overall growth in China, cloud service providers absorbing capacity and a weakening NAND pricing environment. While revenue fell short, we exceeded our EPS outlook by $0.06 or about 5%.
We continued to deliver outstanding new products for our customers and previewed new innovations that position Intel to compete and win for years to come, and we also made significant progress in growth areas like AI, autonomous driving and 5G. I'll take a few minutes to give some specifics before we dive into the financial results.
Over the course of the quarter and culminating at CES, we highlighted breakthrough innovations that will be central to our product leadership for years to come. We outlined our product design philosophy, which combines 6 pillars of innovation: process technology, architecture, memory, interconnect, security features and software to consistently and reliably deliver leadership products that solve our customers' most challenging problems.
One example of this design philosophy in action is our unique Foveros 3D packaging technology. Foveros enables active stacking of logic chiplets for the first time in the industry's history and lets us mix and match process technologies and architectures to deliver breakthrough products. The first such product, Lakefield, is slated for production in 2019.
Lakefield features a 10-nanometer hybrid CPU architecture combining a Sunny Cove CPU core, 4 low-power Atom CPU cores, Gen11 graphics and more in a dime-sized product that enables the smallest PC motherboard ever possible. Foveros gives us tremendous design flexibility and paves the way for a myriad of devices and systems combining high performance, high density and low-power silicon process technologies.
In the data center, we began shipping the new Cascade Lake family of high-performance Xeon processors with DL Boost for accelerated AI performance, hardware-based security mitigations and the first implementation of Optane DC persistent memory. Many of our data-center OEMs and cloud customers are now offering early trials of Intel Optane DC persistent memory, which is enabling entirely new usage models and improved system performance.
In client computing, we launched our new ninth gen Intel Core desktop product lineup for gaming and content creation, growth segments that demand Intel performance. We also previewed our upcoming 10-nanometer Ice Lake client CPUs, which will deliver unprecedented levels of integration, including DL Boost inference acceleration, WiFi 6, Thunderbolt 3 and Gen11 graphics, our first integrated GPU with a full teraflop of performance. Our 10-nanometer yields continue to improve, and Ice Lake remains on track to be in volume systems on retail shelves for the 2019 holiday selling season.
In Q4, we also made important progress in AI, 5G and autonomous driving. For artificial intelligence, we saw accelerating adoption of OpenVINO, our open-source tool kit for neural network optimization and the rapid deployment of AI-based Computer Vision. In addition to the strong adoption of OpenVINO by the developer community, we also launched several new products during the year, including our third-generation Vision processing unit.
Our partners created a catalog of AI-based Vision accelerator cards with our VPU and FPGA products. While digital video was once a vertical within the IoT business, AI-based machine vision is becoming a critical horizontal capability that cuts across all IoTG verticals. And our leadership portfolio, both hardware and software solutions, is removing the barriers to deployment and accelerating IoTG's growth.
We also highlighted a new AI product on our road map, the Nervana Neural Network Processor for Inference, or NNPI, which is designed to accelerate inference workloads and achieve the highest performance per watt in the industry. We expect NNPI to be in production this year.
5G is another big opportunity for both our PC-centric and data-centric businesses. At CES, we unveiled the new 10-nanometer-based network system on chip, codenamed Snow Ridge, developed specifically for 5G wireless access and edge computing. Snow Ridge will bring Intel Architecture into wireless access base stations and allow more computing functions to be distributed out at the edge of the network. We expect to be in production on Snow Ridge in the second half of this year, which is also when we'll deliver our first 5G modem, the Intel XMM 8160 5G.
In autonomous driving and ADAS, mobilized effort to lead this revolution continues to build momentum with 28 new design wins and 78 vehicle model launches in 2018. In the fourth quarter, we announced plans to commercialize mobility as a service in Israel with Volkswagen and Champion Motors, making Mobileye's breadth of products, technologies and services unmatched in the industry.
Mobileye's products now span from open ADAS and AV compute platforms to turnkey vehicle retrofits to, ultimately, mobility as a service. And they are enabled by the industry's best vision algorithms and driving policy software, the groundbreaking RSS model for AV safety and REM real-time crowdsourced maps.
At CES, we announced important progress for both RSS and REM. ITS, China's leading industry organization for transportation standards, approved a proposal to standardize RSS for the China market. We also completed the mapping of Japan's highway system, 25,000 kilometers of roads, using data harvested from a customer fleet of vehicles outfitted with EyeQ4 in just 24 hours.
This is a task that would have previously required thousands of hours of driving and scanning using specialized vehicles. This sort of breakthrough is possible only with Mobileye's combination of technology and massive market scale, and it positions Mobileye to monetize ADAS and AV technology long before Level 4 and 5 autonomy are deployed at scale.
And REM will be monetized in areas beyond autonomous vehicles. We just announced a partnership with Ordnance Survey who use data collected via consumer vehicles outfitted with EyeQ4 to help utilities manage infrastructure.
Looking back at 2018, it is abundantly clear that Intel's employees, the unstoppable engine driving our innovation, are more determined than at any point in our history to make Intel technology the foundation for the world's most important innovations and advances. Not only was it a record year from a financial perspective, we achieved major milestones in terms of our diversity and inclusion goals.
We reached full representation in our U.S. workforce 2 years ahead of our plan. We also achieved gender pay equity across our global workforce. And to celebrate 50 years of Intel, more than 68,000 employees volunteered approximately 1.5 million hours in the communities where we operate. I'm proud of what Intel employees achieved in 2018, and I am equally proud on how they responded to challenges.
With that, let's turn to the financial results. The fourth quarter closed a record 50th anniversary year with strong data-centric and PC-centric growth. Revenue for the quarter was $18.7 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Our data-centric businesses were collectively up 9%, and our PC-centric business was up 10%.
Operating margin of 35% was approximately flat with strong mix and continued spending leverage, offset by 10-nanometer cost and growth in our adjacent businesses. Strong business performance, spending leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in non-GAAP net income of $5.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. EPS of $1.28 was up 18% year-over-year.
For the full year of 2018, we generated $14.3 billion of free cash flow; returned $16.3 billion to shareholders, including $5.5 billion in dividends; repurchased 217 million shares; and increased our buyback authorization by $15 billion. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion short of our October expectations due largely to an increase in accounts receivable.
To summarize, we had a strong quarter and fantastic year with full year revenue up 13% or nearly $6 billion higher than our original forecast in January. Earnings per share was up 32%, and free cash flow was up 38% over last year. We're expecting another record year in 2019. And as a result of our continued growth, we are raising the dividend 5%.
Our leadership products continue to win share in our expanded TAM as both our data-centric and our PC-centric businesses continued to grow in the fourth quarter. Our data-centric businesses were up 9% for the quarter as customers choose our performance products to move, store and process more data faster from the cloud to the edge. And our PC-centric business was up 10%

With that, let me hand it over to Bob.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Interim CEO, Executive VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Mark. And thanks to Navin and Murthy who will participate in the Q&A later in the call.
Before I get into the results, I'll take a minute to address what I expect is a top of mind question: the status of Intel's CEO search. The board continues to evaluate candidates for what I believe is the biggest and best open job on the planet. They are proceeding with a sense of urgency while also ensuring that they make the right choice for this great company.
Meanwhile, Murthy, Navin, the entire management team and 107,000 employees have come together as a team to continue driving Intel's transformation to a data-centric company. Our 2018 results demonstrate the progress we made, and I'd like to share those results with you now.
2018 marked Intel's golden anniversary. It was a truly remarkable year for a remarkable company. Full year revenue grew 13% and crossed the $70 billion mark for the first time, setting an all-time revenue record for the third consecutive year. Our data center, Internet of Things, Programmable Solutions, memory, Mobileye and modem businesses each set all-time full year revenue records.
2018 was also a pivotal year in Intel's transformation to become a data-centric company, pursuing an expanded greater-than-$300 billion market opportunity. Intel's collection of data-centric businesses grew 20% in 2018 after adjusting for McAfee. The largest of our data-centric businesses, the Data Center Group, delivered record annual revenue of $23 billion, up 21% year-over-year on strong cloud demand and growing share with communication service provider customers. Our PC-centric business achieved 9% growth in 2018 as the PC market stabilized, and we gained share in modems.
While 2018 was a record year, we expected a stronger finish. Fourth quarter revenue of $18.7 billion was up 9% but short of our expectations as a result of a dramatically weakening modem demand, lower overall growth in China, cloud service providers absorbing capacity and a weakening NAND pricing environment. While revenue fell short, we exceeded our EPS outlook by $0.06 or about 5%.
We continued to deliver outstanding new products for our customers and previewed new innovations that position Intel to compete and win for years to come, and we also made significant progress in growth areas like AI, autonomous driving and 5G. I'll take a few minutes to give some specifics before we dive into the financial results.
Over the course of the quarter and culminating at CES, we highlighted breakthrough innovations that will be central to our product leadership for years to come. We outlined our product design philosophy, which combines 6 pillars of innovation: process technology, architecture, memory, interconnect, security features and software to consistently and reliably deliver leadership products that solve our customers' most challenging problems.
One example of this design philosophy in action is our unique Foveros 3D packaging technology. Foveros enables active stacking of logic chiplets for the first time in the industry's history and lets us mix and match process technologies and architectures to deliver breakthrough products. The first such product, Lakefield, is slated for production in 2019.
Lakefield features a 10-nanometer hybrid CPU architecture combining a Sunny Cove CPU core, 4 low-power Atom CPU cores, Gen11 graphics and more in a dime-sized product that enables the smallest PC motherboard ever possible. Foveros gives us tremendous design flexibility and paves the way for a myriad of devices and systems combining high performance, high density and low-power silicon process technologies.
In the data center, we began shipping the new Cascade Lake family of high-performance Xeon processors with DL Boost for accelerated AI performance, hardware-based security mitigations and the first implementation of Optane DC persistent memory. Many of our data-center OEMs and cloud customers are now offering early trials of Intel Optane DC persistent memory, which is enabling entirely new usage models and improved system performance.
In client computing, we launched our new ninth gen Intel Core desktop product lineup for gaming and content creation, growth segments that demand Intel performance. We also previewed our upcoming 10-nanometer Ice Lake client CPUs, which will deliver unprecedented levels of integration, including DL Boost inference acceleration, WiFi 6, Thunderbolt 3 and Gen11 graphics, our first integrated GPU with a full teraflop of performance. Our 10-nanometer yields continue to improve, and Ice Lake remains on track to be in volume systems on retail shelves for the 2019 holiday selling season.
In Q4, we also made important progress in AI, 5G and autonomous driving. For artificial intelligence, we saw accelerating adoption of OpenVINO, our open-source tool kit for neural network optimization and the rapid deployment of AI-based Computer Vision. In addition to the strong adoption of OpenVINO by the developer community, we also launched several new products during the year, including our third-generation Vision processing unit.
Our partners created a catalog of AI-based Vision accelerator cards with our VPU and FPGA products. While digital video was once a vertical within the IoT business, AI-based machine vision is becoming a critical horizontal capability that cuts across all IoTG verticals. And our leadership portfolio, both hardware and software solutions, is removing the barriers to deployment and accelerating IoTG's growth.
We also highlighted a new AI product on our road map, the Nervana Neural Network Processor for Inference, or NNPI, which is designed to accelerate inference workloads and achieve the highest performance per watt in the industry. We expect NNPI to be in production this year.
5G is another big opportunity for both our PC-centric and data-centric businesses. At CES, we unveiled the new 10-nanometer-based network system on chip, codenamed Snow Ridge, developed specifically for 5G wireless access and edge computing. Snow Ridge will bring Intel Architecture into wireless access base stations and allow more computing functions to be distributed out at the edge of the network. We expect to be in production on Snow Ridge in the second half of this year, which is also when we'll deliver our first 5G modem, the Intel XMM 8160 5G.
In autonomous driving and ADAS, mobilized effort to lead this revolution continues to build momentum with 28 new design wins and 78 vehicle model launches in 2018. In the fourth quarter, we announced plans to commercialize mobility as a service in Israel with Volkswagen and Champion Motors, making Mobileye's breadth of products, technologies and services unmatched in the industry.
Mobileye's products now span from open ADAS and AV compute platforms to turnkey vehicle retrofits to, ultimately, mobility as a service. And they are enabled by the industry's best vision algorithms and driving policy software, the groundbreaking RSS model for AV safety and REM real-time crowdsourced maps.
At CES, we announced important progress for both RSS and REM. ITS, China's leading industry organization for transportation standards, approved a proposal to standardize RSS for the China market. We also completed the mapping of Japan's highway system, 25,000 kilometers of roads, using data harvested from a customer fleet of vehicles outfitted with EyeQ4 in just 24 hours.
This is a task that would have previously required thousands of hours of driving and scanning using specialized vehicles. This sort of breakthrough is possible only with Mobileye's combination of technology and massive market scale, and it positions Mobileye to monetize ADAS and AV technology long before Level 4 and 5 autonomy are deployed at scale.
And REM will be monetized in areas beyond autonomous vehicles. We just announced a partnership with Ordnance Survey who use data collected via consumer vehicles outfitted with EyeQ4 to help utilities manage infrastructure.
Looking back at 2018, it is abundantly clear that Intel's employees, the unstoppable engine driving our innovation, are more determined than at any point in our history to make Intel technology the foundation for the world's most important innovations and advances. Not only was it a record year from a financial perspective, we achieved major milestones in terms of our diversity and inclusion goals.
We reached full representation in our U.S. workforce 2 years ahead of our plan. We also achieved gender pay equity across our global workforce. And to celebrate 50 years of Intel, more than 68,000 employees volunteered approximately 1.5 million hours in the communities where we operate. I'm proud of what Intel employees achieved in 2018, and I am equally proud on how they responded to challenges.
With that, let's turn to the financial results. The fourth quarter closed a record 50th anniversary year with strong data-centric and PC-centric growth. Revenue for the quarter was $18.7 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Our data-centric businesses were collectively up 9%, and our PC-centric business was up 10%.
Operating margin of 35% was approximately flat with strong mix and continued spending leverage, offset by 10-nanometer cost and growth in our adjacent businesses. Strong business performance, spending leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in non-GAAP net income of $5.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. EPS of $1.28 was up 18% year-over-year.
For the full year of 2018, we generated $14.3 billion of free cash flow; returned $16.3 billion to shareholders, including $5.5 billion in dividends; repurchased 217 million shares; and increased our buyback authorization by $15 billion. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion short of our October expectations due largely to an increase in accounts receivable.
To summarize, we had a strong quarter and fantastic year with full year revenue up 13% or nearly $6 billion higher than our original forecast in January. Earnings per share was up 32%, and free cash flow was up 38% over last year. We're expecting another record year in 2019. And as a result of our continued growth, we are raising the dividend 5%.
Our leadership products continue to win share in our expanded TAM as both our data-centric and our PC-centric businesses continued to grow in the fourth quarter. Our data-centric businesses were up 9% for the quarter as customers choose our performance products to move, store and process more data faster from the cloud to the edge. And our PC-centric business was up 10%

Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Trey. Q3 2019 was the best quarter in our company's history. We generated $19.2 billion in revenue and $1.42 in non-GAAP EPS, exceeding our guidance by $1.2 billion and $0.18, respectively. We achieved record revenue both overall and in our data-centric businesses while making continued progress on our strategic priorities. Simply put, our ambitions have never been greater. We are growing share in a large and expanding $300 billion market opportunity fueled by the exponential growth of data, which is reshaping computing.

I want to start with a recap of our May Analyst Day and our 3 priorities: Accelerating growth, improving execution and deploying capital for attractive returns. First, growth. It starts with a core belief. We are at a key inflection point with the exponential growth of data creating massive demand for semiconductors. Cloud workloads are diversifying. Networks are transforming. And more computing performance is moving to the edge.

We've been on a multiyear journey to reposition the company's portfolio to take advantage of this industry catalyst. Today, we have the product and technology leadership that uniquely positions us to capitalize on these trends and will invest in the IP required to help our customers win the inflections of the future.

The opportunity is massive. As we told you in May, we expect to generate $85 billion in revenue and $6 in EPS in 3 to 4 years. But that doesn't happen just by saying it. Achieving this goal means delivering on our operational and financial priorities every 90 days.

Growth starts with our Core business where our workload-optimized platforms are winning in a highly competitive marketplace. It's now been 9 quarters since the first Xeon Scalable processor launched, and we're proud to have delivered over 23 million units as customers rely on Xeon to power their data-centric workloads.

In the third quarter, leading cloud customers ramped our second-generation Xeon Scalable processors with AWS, Google and Alibaba deploying instances based on Cascade Lake. Customers including BP and TU Darmstadt selected our highest-performance Xeon Scalable platform, the 9200 series, for their most demanding workloads. One key reason customers are choosing Xeon Scalable is the platform's built-in workload acceleration for AI. With the combination of Intel Deep Learning Boost and AVX-512 technologies, we're seeing advantages of up to 9x in AI inference versus competitor CPUs.

We also see cloud and enterprise momentum building for our break-through memory technology, Intel Optane. This quarter, we announced a strategic collaboration with Oracle. Oracle is incorporating the high-performance capabilities of Intel Optane DC persistent memory into its next-generation Exadata platform, which powers high-performance database infrastructure at most of the world's leading banks, telecoms and retailers. And in client computing, we're excited that all our major PC OEM customers have Ice Lake designs, with 18 already shipping out of a total of 30 expected to launch this year.

We recently announced the next generation of Intel Xeon W and X-series processors for high-end desktops. These platforms lead the industry in bringing Intel Deep Learning Boost-powered AI acceleration into high-end PCs and mainstream workstations for the first time. Available soon, these products deliver performance and value that give enthusiasts and creators more reasons to keep choosing Intel.

We've also embarked on a multiyear program, called Project Athena, that charts a course for the PC ecosystem to raise the bar on laptop innovation. Amazing devices like the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 and the HP Elite Dragonfly that meet the Project Athena spec are already available.

Our PC and server franchises are vital, but our ambitions are even greater. We're extending our product leadership to power an increasingly 5G- and AI-enabled world. We have multibillion-dollar networking and IoT/Edge businesses delivering double-digit growth, and AI is driving significant revenue across our product portfolio.

We began investing 10 years ago in network IP, SoC capabilities and software so that we could drive workload convergence on Intel's silicon. Today, we achieved #1 share in the network and silicon market with expected 2019 revenue of more than $5 billion, growing at 12% this year. We're also well-positioned for 5G deployments in 2020 and expect to grow our market segment share in wireless base stations to 40% by 2022. And we're ready for the next market inflection as 5G enables significant new IoT and Edge growth opportunities that extend from in-network and on-premise Edge equipment to smart connected endpoints.

Winning here means blending the right compute performance per watt with the emerging killer apps of the Edge, Computer Vision and AI inference acceleration. These are the differentiating capabilities that have propelled our IOTG and Mobileye businesses to leadership share and the combined annual revenues approaching $5 billion. The businesses are also growing quickly, up 18% year-to-date, excluding Wind River. We're only at the bend of the curve in the Edge opportunity, and we're investing to lead.

Finally, artificial intelligence. AI is becoming a pervasive use case. According to IDC, 75% of enterprise applications will use AI by 2021, and that's why we're infusing AI in everything we build. But this isn't just about the future. We are driving meaningful AI revenue inside Intel now. With products spanning from the data center to the edge, we expect to generate more than $3.5 billion in AI-driven data-centric revenue in 2019, up more than 20% year-over-year.

We're confident in our growth, but we also need to improve our execution on multiple fronts. First, supply. We've increased our output in response to stronger-than-expected demand. We've invested record levels of CapEx the last 2 years to expand our capacity and support our customers' growth. With that investment, we've increased our 14-nanometer capacity 25% this year while also ramping 10-nanometer production. We expect our second half PC Client supply will be up double digits compared to the first half, and we expect to further increase our PC Client supply by mid- to high single digits in 2020. But that growth hasn't been sufficient. We're letting our customers down, and they're expecting more from us.

PC demand has exceeded our expectations and surpassed third-party forecasts. We now think the market is stronger than we forecasted back in Q2, which has made building inventory buffers difficult. We are working hard to regain supply/demand balance, but we expect to continue to be challenged in the fourth quarter.

Our manufacturing process node execution is also improving. We have fabs in Oregon and Israel in volume production on 10-nanometer and will soon start 10-nanometer production in Arizona. Yields are improving ahead of expectations for both client and data center products. The Intel 10-nanometer product era has begun, and our new 10th Gen Core Ice Lake processors are leading the way.

In Q3, we also shipped our first 10-nanometer Agilex FPGAs. And in 2020, we'll continue to expand our 10-nanometer portfolio with exciting new products, including an AI inference accelerator, 5G base station SoC, Xeon CPUs for server storage and network, and a discrete GPU. This quarter, we've achieved power-on exits for our first discrete GPU, DG1, an important milestone.

As we discussed at the May investor meeting, we are accelerating the pace of process node introductions and moving back to a 2- to 2.5-year cadence. Our process technology and design engineering teams are working closely to ease process design complexity and balance schedule, performance, power and cost. We are on track to launch our first 7-nanometer-based product, a data center-focused discrete GPU, in 2021, 2 years after the launch of 10-nanometer. We are also well down the engineering path on 5-nanometer.

Last, a few thoughts on our capital deployment priorities. We are confident in our future, and our Board has approved an additional $20 billion share buyback authorization. We have an excellent balance sheet, generate strong free cash flow and continue to invest in R&D and CapEx to grow. We've also returned 100% free cash flow to shareholders over the last 10 years.

At the same time, we're making tradeoffs. While we've increased R&D spending by more than $1 billion since 2015, we have reduced our total spending by 9 points over the same period.

Additionally, we have established clear criteria for our big bets like Mobileye, 5G, and memory and storage. Our ambitions are to play a larger role in our customers' success and generate attractive returns for our shareholders. And if we can't do both, we'll take swift action.

We are making great progress with our Mobileye acquisition. We've now shipped over 12 million EyeQ devices this year, up more than 40% over the same period last year. And in the third quarter, we delivered record revenue and secured 6 major new design wins, totaling nearly 10 million lifetime units.

We've increased our investment in 5G, but we've also announced our 5G smartphone modem exit and the sale of the IMFT fab to Micron. We expect those to close in the fourth quarter. And we continue to take steps to improve 3D NAND profitability and reduce memory CapEx investments while evaluating a variety of partnership options that can accelerate the path to profitability and improve returns.

We are confident in our multiyear business plan. And consistent with that, we are increasing our buyback commitment. We expect to repurchase approximately 20 billion shares over the next 15 to 18 months. We'll fund the buyback from proceeds we generate from partnerships and/or noncore asset dispositions and by returning approximately 100% of 2020 free cash flow to investors.

In summary, our energies are focused on accelerating our growth, improving our execution and allocating our capital wisely. Thanks to the team for a great quarter.

And now I'll hand the call over to George for more details on our Q3 results and business outlook.

Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Trey. Q3 2019 was the best quarter in our company's history. We generated $19.2 billion in revenue and $1.42 in non-GAAP EPS, exceeding our guidance by $1.2 billion and $0.18, respectively. We achieved record revenue both overall and in our data-centric businesses while making continued progress on our strategic priorities. Simply put, our ambitions have never been greater. We are growing share in a large and expanding $300 billion market opportunity fueled by the exponential growth of data, which is reshaping computing.

I want to start with a recap of our May Analyst Day and our 3 priorities: Accelerating growth, improving execution and deploying capital for attractive returns. First, growth. It starts with a core belief. We are at a key inflection point with the exponential growth of data creating massive demand for semiconductors. Cloud workloads are diversifying. Networks are transforming. And more computing performance is moving to the edge.

We've been on a multiyear journey to reposition the company's portfolio to take advantage of this industry catalyst. Today, we have the product and technology leadership that uniquely positions us to capitalize on these trends and will invest in the IP required to help our customers win the inflections of the future.

The opportunity is massive. As we told you in May, we expect to generate $85 billion in revenue and $6 in EPS in 3 to 4 years. But that doesn't happen just by saying it. Achieving this goal means delivering on our operational and financial priorities every 90 days.

Growth starts with our Core business where our workload-optimized platforms are winning in a highly competitive marketplace. It's now been 9 quarters since the first Xeon Scalable processor launched, and we're proud to have delivered over 23 million units as customers rely on Xeon to power their data-centric workloads.

In the third quarter, leading cloud customers ramped our second-generation Xeon Scalable processors with AWS, Google and Alibaba deploying instances based on Cascade Lake. Customers including BP and TU Darmstadt selected our highest-performance Xeon Scalable platform, the 9200 series, for their most demanding workloads. One key reason customers are choosing Xeon Scalable is the platform's built-in workload acceleration for AI. With the combination of Intel Deep Learning Boost and AVX-512 technologies, we're seeing advantages of up to 9x in AI inference versus competitor CPUs.

We also see cloud and enterprise momentum building for our break-through memory technology, Intel Optane. This quarter, we announced a strategic collaboration with Oracle. Oracle is incorporating the high-performance capabilities of Intel Optane DC persistent memory into its next-generation Exadata platform, which powers high-performance database infrastructure at most of the world's leading banks, telecoms and retailers. And in client computing, we're excited that all our major PC OEM customers have Ice Lake designs, with 18 already shipping out of a total of 30 expected to launch this year.

We recently announced the next generation of Intel Xeon W and X-series processors for high-end desktops. These platforms lead the industry in bringing Intel Deep Learning Boost-powered AI acceleration into high-end PCs and mainstream workstations for the first time. Available soon, these products deliver performance and value that give enthusiasts and creators more reasons to keep choosing Intel.

We've also embarked on a multiyear program, called Project Athena, that charts a course for the PC ecosystem to raise the bar on laptop innovation. Amazing devices like the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 and the HP Elite Dragonfly that meet the Project Athena spec are already available.

Our PC and server franchises are vital, but our ambitions are even greater. We're extending our product leadership to power an increasingly 5G- and AI-enabled world. We have multibillion-dollar networking and IoT/Edge businesses delivering double-digit growth, and AI is driving significant revenue across our product portfolio.

We began investing 10 years ago in network IP, SoC capabilities and software so that we could drive workload convergence on Intel's silicon. Today, we achieved #1 share in the network and silicon market with expected 2019 revenue of more than $5 billion, growing at 12% this year. We're also well-positioned for 5G deployments in 2020 and expect to grow our market segment share in wireless base stations to 40% by 2022. And we're ready for the next market inflection as 5G enables significant new IoT and Edge growth opportunities that extend from in-network and on-premise Edge equipment to smart connected endpoints.

Winning here means blending the right compute performance per watt with the emerging killer apps of the Edge, Computer Vision and AI inference acceleration. These are the differentiating capabilities that have propelled our IOTG and Mobileye businesses to leadership share and the combined annual revenues approaching $5 billion. The businesses are also growing quickly, up 18% year-to-date, excluding Wind River. We're only at the bend of the curve in the Edge opportunity, and we're investing to lead.

Finally, artificial intelligence. AI is becoming a pervasive use case. According to IDC, 75% of enterprise applications will use AI by 2021, and that's why we're infusing AI in everything we build. But this isn't just about the future. We are driving meaningful AI revenue inside Intel now. With products spanning from the data center to the edge, we expect to generate more than $3.5 billion in AI-driven data-centric revenue in 2019, up more than 20% year-over-year.

We're confident in our growth, but we also need to improve our execution on multiple fronts. First, supply. We've increased our output in response to stronger-than-expected demand. We've invested record levels of CapEx the last 2 years to expand our capacity and support our customers' growth. With that investment, we've increased our 14-nanometer capacity 25% this year while also ramping 10-nanometer production. We expect our second half PC Client supply will be up double digits compared to the first half, and we expect to further increase our PC Client supply by mid- to high single digits in 2020. But that growth hasn't been sufficient. We're letting our customers down, and they're expecting more from us.

PC demand has exceeded our expectations and surpassed third-party forecasts. We now think the market is stronger than we forecasted back in Q2, which has made building inventory buffers difficult. We are working hard to regain supply/demand balance, but we expect to continue to be challenged in the fourth quarter.

Our manufacturing process node execution is also improving. We have fabs in Oregon and Israel in volume production on 10-nanometer and will soon start 10-nanometer production in Arizona. Yields are improving ahead of expectations for both client and data center products. The Intel 10-nanometer product era has begun, and our new 10th Gen Core Ice Lake processors are leading the way.

In Q3, we also shipped our first 10-nanometer Agilex FPGAs. And in 2020, we'll continue to expand our 10-nanometer portfolio with exciting new products, including an AI inference accelerator, 5G base station SoC, Xeon CPUs for server storage and network, and a discrete GPU. This quarter, we've achieved power-on exits for our first discrete GPU, DG1, an important milestone.

As we discussed at the May investor meeting, we are accelerating the pace of process node introductions and moving back to a 2- to 2.5-year cadence. Our process technology and design engineering teams are working closely to ease process design complexity and balance schedule, performance, power and cost. We are on track to launch our first 7-nanometer-based product, a data center-focused discrete GPU, in 2021, 2 years after the launch of 10-nanometer. We are also well down the engineering path on 5-nanometer.

Last, a few thoughts on our capital deployment priorities. We are confident in our future, and our Board has approved an additional $20 billion share buyback authorization. We have an excellent balance sheet, generate strong free cash flow and continue to invest in R&D and CapEx to grow. We've also returned 100% free cash flow to shareholders over the last 10 years.

At the same time, we're making tradeoffs. While we've increased R&D spending by more than $1 billion since 2015, we have reduced our total spending by 9 points over the same period.

Additionally, we have established clear criteria for our big bets like Mobileye, 5G, and memory and storage. Our ambitions are to play a larger role in our customers' success and generate attractive returns for our shareholders. And if we can't do both, we'll take swift action.

We are making great progress with our Mobileye acquisition. We've now shipped over 12 million EyeQ devices this year, up more than 40% over the same period last year. And in the third quarter, we delivered record revenue and secured 6 major new design wins, totaling nearly 10 million lifetime units.

We've increased our investment in 5G, but we've also announced our 5G smartphone modem exit and the sale of the IMFT fab to Micron. We expect those to close in the fourth quarter. And we continue to take steps to improve 3D NAND profitability and reduce memory CapEx investments while evaluating a variety of partnership options that can accelerate the path to profitability and improve returns.

We are confident in our multiyear business plan. And consistent with that, we are increasing our buyback commitment. We expect to repurchase approximately 20 billion shares over the next 15 to 18 months. We'll fund the buyback from proceeds we generate from partnerships and/or noncore asset dispositions and by returning approximately 100% of 2020 free cash flow to investors.

In summary, our energies are focused on accelerating our growth, improving our execution and allocating our capital wisely. Thanks to the team for a great quarter.

And now I'll hand the call over to George for more details on our Q3 results and business outlook.

          Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone.

We had an outstanding Q3 with record revenue of $19.2 billion, approximately flat year-on-year and $1.2 billion higher than guide. We saw record data-centric revenue of $9.5 billion, representing just under 50% of our total revenue, an all-time high. DCG, IOTG, NSG and Mobileye all individually achieved record revenue in the quarter. PC-centric revenue was down 5% year-on-year on a very tough compare.

Q3 operating margin was approximately 36%, 1 point ahead of our guide

We're having technical difficulties. Let me jump back in here. I'm joined today by our CEO, Bob Swan; our CFO, George Davis; and in a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by the Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
A brief reminder that this quarter, we have provided GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when we describe our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. 
With that, let me hand it over to Bob.

Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Mark. With the interim introduction, I thought on our outlook I was getting demoted already. But look, coming off a record 2018, our top line results came in slightly higher than expectations, with upsides in the PC and IoT segments, offset by incremental NAND pricing weakness. Total revenue of $16.1 billion was flat year-over-year, as our PC-centric business grew 4% and our data-centric businesses were down 5%. The team executed well, though underlying trends are concerning, and as a result, we've revised our expectations down for the full year.
I'll give you some insight into the customer trends informing our outlook, but first, I'd like to take a few minutes to recap the progress we've made over the first quarter. It's been just under 3 months since I was honored with the best job in the world. At that time, I said that our leadership team would focus relentlessly on delivering for our customers to take advantage of the biggest opportunity in our company's history. We're making important progress by intensifying our focus in 3 key areas: expanding our TAM, accelerating innovation and improving our execution while evolving our culture. I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about our philosophy and progress in each of those areas.
First, expanding our TAM. We are transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, and our ambitions are bigger than they've ever been. Our aim is to identify and capitalize on key technology inflections that set us up to play a larger role in our customers' success while improving returns for our owners. You can see the impact of this approach in our Q1 execution.
For example, our first-ever data-centric portfolio launch marked an important milestone in our efforts to capitalize on the AI opportunity and undisputed technology inflection. Our new second-generation Xeon Scalable is the only processor in the industry with built-in artificial intelligence acceleration. Not only did we deliver a 14x generation-over-generation performance improvement, but we also showed CPU performance beating GPU performance on major AI workloads like recommendation engines. And we worked closely with the software industry ahead of the launch to deliver a great out-of-the-box experience for customers like Siemens. They're collaborating with us on a breakthrough AI-based cardiac MRI model. This application has the potential to provide real-time diagnosis using the DL Boost technology in our newest Xeon Scalable processor.
Another TAM-expanding business that continues to gain traction is Mobileye, with 8 new global ADAS designs in the first quarter alone, including our first win in India. Mobileye's real-time crowd-sourced mapping technology, Road Experience Management or REM, continues to build momentum with a major North American automaker adopting this breakthrough data-centric capability. Autonomous driving is a technology inflection that we're ready to lead.
2019 will be a foundational year for another disruptive technology, 5G. As you know, we recently sharpened our 5G focus. When it became apparent that we don't have a clear path to profitability in 5G smartphone modems, we acted. We are now winding down that business and conducting a strategic assessment of 5G modems for the PC and IoT sectors while continuing to meet our current 4G customer commitments. By acting now, we focus our 5G efforts on the transformation of the wireless network and edge infrastructure, where we have a clear technology advantage, market share to win and a strategic role to play with customers.
At Mobile World Congress, we demonstrated a range of 5G products under development, including the 5G-ready N3000 FPGA acceleration card and the new 10-nanometer-based Snow Ridge network SoC for use in 5G base stations. As networks cloudify, Intel is in a great position to win in this base station segment, where we expect to grow to 40% market segment share by 2022. The vast majority of the 5G market opportunity and profit is in the transformation of network and edge infrastructure, where we are now laser focused.
Next, accelerating innovation. Successfully competing in a bigger TAM requires a broad range of products and technologies. Only Intel has the breadth of IP to deliver leadership products across increasingly diverse workloads for the data-centric era. Harnessing data for discovery, invention and business value is not a one-size-fits-all computing challenge. That's why we are investing in 6 important pillars of innovation: process technology, architecture, memory, interconnect, security features and software. Already this year, we've introduced incredible examples of this approach to innovation across the business. Let me take a minute to talk about a few.
We are currently architecting what we expect will be the United States' first exascale supercomputer for the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory. This supercomputer, called Aurora, will be delivered in 2021 and powered by Intel technologies designed specifically for the convergence of artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. These include a future generation of the Intel Xeon Scalable processor, Intel's Xe compute architecture, a future generation of Optane persistent memory and Intel's One API software. It's a great example of how our data-centric products architected together can deliver technology breakthroughs for our customers. 
We are also accelerating innovation in our PC-centric business. For example, our team is hard at work with our OEM customers to define and deliver a stunning new class of next-generation laptops. We call this Project Athena, and the first of these sleek, beautiful designs are coming in the second half of 2019. And just this week, we launched the most powerful generation of Intel Core mobile processors ever, designed for gamers and content creators.
On the process technology front, our teams executed well in Q1 and our velocity is increasing. We remain on track to have volume client systems on shelves for the holiday selling season. And over the past 4 months, the organization drove a nearly 2x improvement in the rate at which 10-nanometer products moved through our factories.
Finally, execution and culture. This is about concentrating our resources on the vital few programs that will have an impact on our customers' success and our owners' return, rather than the trivial many. Over the last couple of years, that focus has resulted in exiting McAfee and wearables business, shutting down Saffron and divesting Wind River. And our spending as a percentage of revenue has gone from approximately 36% to about 30% this quarter. It has allowed us to invest more of our resources, and just as importantly, our collective attention and focus, where it really counts. By doing fewer things, we'll execute better at the things that matter most.
Specific areas where we need to improve execution include meeting customer demand and delivering on our 10-nanometer lineup of products, and we are making progress. Our supply constraints have had a disruptive impact on our customers and ecosystem. We've committed never again to be a constraint on our customers' growth. We've increased capacity to improve our position in the second half, although product mix will continue to be a challenge in the third quarter as our teams align available supply with customer demand.
As I shared earlier, our confidence in 10-nanometer is also improving. In addition to the manufacturing velocity improvement I described earlier, we expect to qualify our first volume 10-nanometer product, Icelake, this quarter and are increasing our 10-nanometer volume goals for the year.
I'll shift now to our full year outlook. Going forward, George will deliver our forecast. But given this is his third week with us, I'll share my thoughts on our full year reset and he'll review our first quarter results and second quarter guide.
Our conversations with customers and partners across our PC and data-centric businesses over the past couple of months have made several trends clear. The decline in memory pricing has intensified. The data center inventory and capacity digestion that we described in January is more pronounced than we expected, and China headwinds have increased, leading to a more cautious IT spending environment. And yet those same customer conversations reinforce our confidence that demand will improve in the second half. So we've reassessed our '19 expectations based on the challenges we're seeing.
Our full year outlook is now $69 billion in revenue, down 3% year-over-year and down approximately $2.5 billion from our previous estimate. Given the magnitude of change, we'll be somewhat more granular in explaining the drivers. We now see data-centric revenue down low single digits year-over-year, with DCG down mid-single digits year-over-year off a tough compare, continued China weakness and inventory and capacity absorption. We are also anticipating an incrementally more challenging NAND pricing environment.
Our PC-centric forecast remains unchanged at low single digits. We are forecasting operating margin to be 32%, down approximately 3 points year-over-year and down approximately 2 points from our previous guide. This outlook reflects lower full year revenue and a year-over-year decline in gross margins as a result of the 10-nanometer ramp and NAND pricing.
We continue to see good discipline on spending and expect our exit from the 5G smartphone modem segment, annualized in 2018 spending actions, and incremental spending efficiencies to reduce OpEx by approximately $1 billion year-over-year, partially offsetting the impact of lower gross margin. We now forecast full year EPS at $4.35 per share, down approximately 5% year-over-year and $0.25 from our previous guide. We now expect our full year tax rate to be 12%, up 1 point year-over-year and down 1.5 points versus our prior guide, largely as a result of lower pretax income.
Before I hand the call over to George, I'd like to welcome him as Intel's new CFO. I've known George for a long time from his CFO days at Applied Materials while I was a board member. He

          Thanks, Mark. With the interim introduction, I thought on our outlook I was getting demoted already. But look, coming off a record 2018, our top line results came in slightly higher than expectations, with upsides in the PC and IoT segments, offset by incremental NAND pricing weakness. Total revenue of $16.1 billion was flat year-over-year, as our PC-centric business grew 4% and our data-centric businesses were down 5%. The team executed well, though underlying trends are concerning, and as a result, we've revised our expectations down for the full year.
I'll give you some insight into the customer trends informing our outlook, but first, I'd like to take a few minutes to recap the progress we've made over the first quarter. It's been just under 3 months since I was honored with the best job in the world. At that time, I said that our leadership team would focus relentlessly on delivering for our customers to take advantage of the biggest opportunity in our company's history. We're making important progress by intensifying our focus in 3 key areas: expanding our TAM, accelerating innovation and improving our execution while evolving our culture. I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about our philosophy and progress in each of those areas.
First, expanding our TAM. We are transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, and our ambitions are bigger than they've ever been. Our aim is to identify and capitalize on key technology inflections that set us up to play a larger role in our customers' success while improving returns for our owners. You can see the impact of this approach in our Q1 execution.
For example, our first-ever data-centric portfolio launch marked an important milestone in our efforts to capitalize on the AI opportunity and undisputed technology inflection. Our new second-generation Xeon Scalable is the only processor in the industry with built-in artificial intelligence acceleration. Not only did we deliver a 14x generation-over-generation performance improvement, but we also showed CPU performance beating GPU performance on major AI workloads like recommendation engines. And we worked closely with the software industry ahead of the launch to deliver a great out-of-the-box experience for customers like Siemens. They're collaborating with us on a breakthrough AI-based cardiac MRI model. This application has the potential to provide real-time diagnosis using the DL Boost technology in our newest Xeon Scalable processor.
Another TAM-expanding business that continues to gain traction is Mobileye, with 8 new global ADAS designs in the first quarter alone, including our first win in India. Mobileye's real-time crowd-sourced mapping technology, Road Experience Management or REM, continues to build momentum with a major North American automaker adopting this breakthrough data-centric capability. Autonomous driving is a technology inflection that we're ready to lead.
2019 will be a foundational year for another disruptive technology, 5G. As you know, we recently sharpened our 5G focus. When it became apparent that we don't have a clear path to profitability in 5G smartphone modems, we acted. We are now winding down that business and conducting a strategic assessment of 5G modems for the PC and IoT sectors while continuing to meet our current 4G customer commitments. By acting now, we focus our 5G efforts on the transformation of the wireless network and edge infrastructure, where we have a clear technology advantage, market share to win and a strategic role to play with customers.
At Mobile World Congress, we demonstrated a range of 5G products under development, including the 5G-ready N3000 FPGA acceleration card and the new 10-nanometer-based Snow Ridge network SoC for use in 5G base stations. As networks cloudify, Intel is in a great position to win in this base station segment, where we expect to grow to 40% market segment share by 2022. The vast majority of the 5G market opportunity and profit is in the transformation of network and edge infrastructure, where we are now laser focused.
Next, accelerating innovation. Successfully competing in a bigger TAM requires a broad range of products and technologies. Only Intel has the breadth of IP to deliver leadership products across increasingly diverse workloads for the data-centric era. Harnessing data for discovery, invention and business value is not a one-size-fits-all computing challenge. That's why we are investing in 6 important pillars of innovation: process technology, architecture, memory, interconnect, security features and software. Already this year, we've introduced incredible examples of this approach to innovation across the business. Let me take a minute to talk about a few.
We are currently architecting what we expect will be the United States' first exascale supercomputer for the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory. This supercomputer, called Aurora, will be delivered in 2021 and powered by Intel technologies designed specifically for the convergence of artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. These include a future generation of the Intel Xeon Scalable processor, Intel's Xe compute architecture, a future generation of Optane persistent memory and Intel's One API software. It's a great example of how our data-centric products architected together can deliver technology breakthroughs for our customers. 
We are also accelerating innovation in our PC-centric business. For example, our team is hard at work with our OEM customers to define and deliver a stunning new class of next-generation laptops. We call this Project Athena, and the first of these sleek, beautiful designs are coming in the second half of 2019. And just this week, we launched the most powerful generation of Intel Core mobile processors ever, designed for gamers and content creators.
On the process technology front, our teams executed well in Q1 and our velocity is increasing. We remain on track to have volume client systems on shelves for the holiday selling season. And over the past 4 months, the organization drove a nearly 2x improvement in the rate at which 10-nanometer products moved through our factories.
Finally, execution and culture. This is about concentrating our resources on the vital few programs that will have an impact on our customers' success and our owners' return, rather than the trivial many. Over the last couple of years, that focus has resulted in exiting McAfee and wearables business, shutting down Saffron and divesting Wind River. And our spending as a percentage of revenue has gone from approximately 36% to about 30% this quarter. It has allowed us to invest more of our resources, and just as importantly, our collective attention and focus, where it really counts. By doing fewer things, we'll execute better at the things that matter most.
Specific areas where we need to improve execution include meeting customer demand and delivering on our 10-nanometer lineup of products, and we are making progress. Our supply constraints have had a disruptive impact on our customers and ecosystem. We've committed never again to be a constraint on our customers' growth. We've increased capacity to improve our position in the second half, although product mix will continue to be a challenge in the third quarter as our teams align available supply with customer demand.
As I shared earlier, our confidence in 10-nanometer is also improving. In addition to the manufacturing velocity improvement I described earlier, we expect to qualify our first volume 10-nanometer product, Icelake, this quarter and are increasing our 10-nanometer volume goals for the year.
I'll shift now to our full year outlook. Going forward, George will deliver our forecast. But given this is his third week with us, I'll share my thoughts on our full year reset and he'll review our first quarter results and second quarter guide.
Our conversations with customers and partners across our PC and data-centric businesses over the past couple of months have made several trends clear. The decline in memory pricing has intensified. The data center inventory and capacity digestion that we described in January is more pronounced than we expected, and China headwinds have increased, leading to a more cautious IT spending environment. And yet those same customer conversations reinforce our confidence that demand will improve in the second half. So we've reassessed our '19 expectations based on the challenges we're seeing.
Our full year outlook is now $69 billion in revenue, down 3% year-over-year and down approximately $2.5 billion from our previous estimate. Given the magnitude of change, we'll be somewhat more granular in explaining the drivers. We now see data-centric revenue down low single digits year-over-year, with DCG down mid-single digits year-over-year off a tough compare, continued China weakness and inventory and capacity absorption. We are also anticipating an incrementally more challenging NAND pricing environment.
Our PC-centric forecast remains unchanged at low single digits. We are forecasting operating margin to be 32%, down approximately 3 points year-over-year and down approximately 2 points from our previous guide. This outlook reflects lower full year revenue and a year-over-year decline in gross margins as a result of the 10-nanometer ramp and NAND pricing.
We continue to see good discipline on spending and expect our exit from the 5G smartphone modem segment, annualized in 2018 spending actions, and incremental spending efficiencies to reduce OpEx by approximately $1 billion year-over-year, partially offsetting the impact of lower gross margin. We now forecast full year EPS at $4.35 per share, down approximately 5% year-over-year and $0.25 from our previous guide. We now expect our full year tax rate to be 12%, up 1 point year-over-year and down 1.5 points versus our prior guide, largely as a result of lower pretax income.
Before I hand the call over to George, I'd like to welcome him as Intel's new CFO. I've known George for a long time from his CFO days at Applied Materials while I was a board member. He

The PC-centric business grew 4%, while the data-centric businesses were down 5%. The CEO, Bob Swan, expressed concerns about the underlying trends.

In terms of expanding their total addressable market (TAM), Intel is focused on transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. They aim to capitalize on key technology inflections such as AI, autonomous driving, and 5G. The company launched their first-ever data-centric portfolio, including the second-generation Xeon Scalable processor with built-in AI acceleration. They are also making progress in the autonomous driving market with their Mobileye technology. However, their 5G smartphone modem business is being wound down due to a lack of clear profitability, and they will instead focus on the transformation of the wireless network and edge infrastructure.

Intel is also committed to accelerating innovation across various pillars, including process technology, architecture, memory, interconnect, security features, and software. They are collaborating on the development of the United States' first exascale supercomputer and are working on next-generation laptops under Project Athena. They have also made progress in their process technology, with a nearly 2x improvement in the rate at which 10-nanometer products are moving through their factories.

Execution and culture are key focus areas for Intel. They are concentrating their resources on the vital few programs that will have the most impact, resulting in the exit of non-core businesses and a reduction in spending as a percentage of revenue. However, they acknowledge the need to improve execution in meeting customer demand and delivering their 10-nanometer lineup of products.

Regarding their full-year outlook, Intel has revised their expectations down due to challenges in the market. They now forecast $69 billion in revenue, down 3% year-over-year. Data-centric revenue is expected to be down low single digits, with continued weakness in China and a more challenging NAND pricing environment. PC-centric forecast remains unchanged at low single digits. The operating margin is anticipated to be 32%, down approximately 3 points year-over-year. Intel expects their full year EPS to be $4.35 per share, down approximately 5% year-over-year.

Overall, Intel is facing challenges in the market, particularly in the data center business and NAND pricing, but they remain confident that demand will improve in the second half of the year. They are focused on expanding their TAM, accelerating innovation, improving execution, and optimizing their spending to drive growth in the data-centric era.",gpt-3

Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Mark. Q2 was an outstanding quarter in which we set a number of records. We beat the expectations we set in April, primarily as a result of stronger desktop and notebook microprocessor volume, and set a second quarter revenue record. We're executing well to our priorities. And after adjusting for the McAfee transaction, revenue grew 14% year-over-year, while non-GAAP operating margin grew 30%. Our data-centric businesses were up 16% year-over-year. 
Technology and performance leadership are fueling our results. And in Q2, we extended our leadership with new breakthrough products in client computing, the data center and memory. With industry-leading products and a strong first half results, we're on a clear path for another record year. 
As we shared in February and reinforced in April, our strategy is to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. I outlined our top 4 priorities for the year in support of that strategy: growing the data center and adjacencies, ensuring a strong and healthy PC business, growing IoT and devices and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs. 
I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight our progress in Q2. First, DCG. The data center business grew 9% in Q2 and remained on track to high single-digit growth for the year. Strong public cloud growth continued, with revenue up 35%. Enterprise was down 11%, as workloads continue to migrate to the cloud and memory and solid-state drive constraints impacted server deployment. Comms service provider revenue was up 17%, while adjacencies, which serve all customer segments, rose 12%. Cloud and comms service provider together are the growth engine in the data center and together now make up 60% of our DCG revenue. 
In 5G, we're demonstrating end-to-end leadership in client and infrastructure. We have 5 ongoing trials with leading global service providers and 15 more in the pipeline. And we're on track with our development of IA, FPGA and ASIC silicon platforms based on new radio standards. 
Earlier this month, we launched Xeon Scalable, formerly known as Skylake, and with it the industry's biggest platform advancement in a decade. Using Xeon Scalable, our customers have already achieved over 50 third-party-verified performance world records and are seeing more than 1.6x performance increase over our prior generation product across a wide range of real-world workloads.
For example, the new AVX-512 instructions, double floating point performance, benefiting use cases like HPC, VR and AI. In fact, artificial intelligence inference throughput improves by 2.4x gen-to-gen. And when this silicon innovation is combined with our AI software frameworks optimization, customers, like Amazon Web Services, are seeing inference performance for improvement of more than 100x. The enthusiasm for Xeon Scalable resulted in our largest early ship program ever. We delivered more than 500,000 units to over 30 customers who appreciate outright performance leadership. The data center is central to our strategy and is a remarkable opportunity. By 2021, we expect the data center to be a $65 billion silicon opportunity, and we're less than 40% of the total available segment today. 
As we build out the adjacencies like Ethernet, silicon photonics and 3D XPoint memory and pool them all together with rack scale design, we'll be positioned to deliver even higher levels of performance and efficiency to our customers and increase our percentage of the total TAM. 
The Client Computing Group also delivered fantastic result. Revenue was up 12% over last year, as product leadership, combined with a disciplined segmentation strategy, led to rising core mix. We, along with our customers and partners in the PC supply chain, are driving the evolution of the PC experience, as users seek out high performance and new form factors. 
We launched a powerful, new Intel Core X-Series processor family, including a new Core i9 Extreme Edition Processor, extending our performance leadership. And we'll be shipping our first 10-nanometer product near the end of the year, beginning with a lower volume SKU and followed by multiple SKUs and a volume ramp in the first half of 2018. We've seen some modest improvements in the PC consumption, but we continue to expect a mid-single-digit TAM decline for the full year. 
We also began shipping our next-generation 4G LTE modem, known as the 7480, to customers. As I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to make great progress with our wireless ecosystem laying the groundwork for 5G. And starting in 2018, Intel will partner on what is expected to be the first 5G showcase at the Olympic Games. 
In our Internet of Things business, we're focused on 4 key verticals: retail, video, industrial and transportation. We saw strong growth across all 4, leading to a 26% increase in revenue. We're specifically excited to see the ramp of our IVI designs with both Jaguar Land Rover and Toyota. We're also about to mark a very important milestone in our transformation. 
We expect to close the acquisition of Mobileye in the third quarter, several months earlier than expected. Autonomous driving is a massive compute workload that will disrupt industries and save lives, and we are investing to win in this important segment. I'm excited to welcome the Mobileye team to Intel. Together, we expect to be the global leader in the $70 billion autonomous driving system, data and services market opportunity by accelerating auto industry innovation and delivering cloud to car solutions faster and at a lower cost. And we're looking forward to talking with you in more detail about our plan and the progress we're making in the segment later this quarter.
Memory and FPGAs round out our priorities for the year. Our memory business grew 58% over last year, setting an all-time revenue record. A cornerstone for our strategy in this segment is differentiated technology. And that differentiation was on display earlier this month when we announced availability of the industry's first and to date only 64-layer 3D NAND SSDs. Our floating gate architecture already enabled industry-leading density at 32 layers. And we believe our density lead is even greater at 64. 
We also shipped more than 200,000 units of our revolutionary Optane memory for clients, which are available via our OEM partners and channel partners, and have more than 50 data center customers testing Optane SSDs currently, which will ship for revenue this year. Optane DIMMs remaining on track for availability next year. 
Our memory factory, Fab 68, continues to exceed expectations, ramping ahead of schedule in terms of both output and yield. This will be a big part of our overall supply growth in the second half, which we expect to be greater than 20%. The combination of strong execution and favorable market condition is accelerating our path to profitability. Core NAND returned to profitability this quarter, ahead of our earlier estimate, and we expected it to remain profitable for the balance of the year. We also now expect the entire NSG segment to be profitable for the full year of 2018 versus our prior end of 2018 target. 
Lastly, our FPGA business was down 5% over last year on weaker data center and comp sectors but remain on track to our mid-single-digit growth target for the full year with broad re-acceleration in the second half across markets, including the data center segment. At their Build Conference in May, Microsoft disclosed a major advancement in the deployment of Intel FPGAs, resulting in the industry's fastest public cloud network and new technology for acceleration of deep neural networks. Audi selected Intel for the level 3 autonomous driving systems in its upcoming A8, where our Cyclone V SoC FPGA technology will perform object and map fusion as well as parking pilot and sensor data preprocessing. We're also seeing strong adoption of our 14-nanometer Stratix 10 FPGAs. We continue to gain key design wins in our focus segments, and we're on track to production later this year. 
To sum it up, I'm very pleased with our progress, and I'm more confident than ever in Intel's future and growth. Based on our strong first half and higher expectations for the PC business and the expected close of Mobileye, we're raising our full year revenue forecast from $60 billion to $61.3 billion and our non-GAAP EPS forecast from $2.85 to $3. 
We continue to see intense competition across our businesses. That's the reality of the attractive markets in which we participate. The competition makes us stronger, and we're ready for it. We're executing well to our strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. The PC TAM is down more than 15% versus 4 years ago. Despite that headwind, our revenue is up more than 15%, and our operating profit has grown more than 30%. More than 40% of our revenue now comes from our data-centric businesses, outside the PC sector. And those businesses together are growing at double-digit rates. And while we're growing the top line, we're intensely focused on operating efficiency. 
We now expect spending as a percent of revenue to decline about 160 basis points versus last year, bringing it below 34%, on track to the 30% goal we're committed to, to hit by 2020. And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Bob.

          Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon. Like Brian said, we had an outstanding quarter and executed on several important milestones. Revenue was $14.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, excluding the Intel Security Group. From an earnings perspective, operating income was $4.2 billion, up 30% year-over-year, and EPS of $0.72 was up 22% year-over-year. Our EPS performance was the result of strong top line growth, good gross margin improvement and excellent spending leverage. From a capital allocation perspective, we generated $4.7 billion in cash flow from operations, returned $2.6 billion to shareholders and have capital in place to fund the Mobileye acquisition. The planned acquisition of Mobileye, which will fuel our growth in the automotive segment, is expected to close in Q3, well ahead of our schedule. 
At our Analyst Day in February, we talked about our strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, a company well positioned to power the cloud and the billions of smart and connected devices. Our Q2 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation, with the data-centric businesses, those outside of the PC segment, up 16% year-over-year. Our PC-centric business executed extremely well in a declining market and was up 12%. Our data-centric businesses are more than 40% of the company's overall revenue.
Moving to earnings. We are seeing broad growth across the business, driving 4 points of operating margin leverage and 22% EPS growth year-over-year. Earnings growth is driven by strong top line growth for both the PC and data-centric businesses, improving unit cost

Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thanks, Mark. Q2 was an outstanding quarter in which we set a number of records. We beat the expectations we set in April, primarily as a result of stronger desktop and notebook microprocessor volume, and set a second quarter revenue record. We're executing well to our priorities. And after adjusting for the McAfee transaction, revenue grew 14% year-over-year, while non-GAAP operating margin grew 30%. Our data-centric businesses were up 16% year-over-year. \nTechnology and performance leadership are fueling our results. And in Q2, we extended our leadership with new breakthrough products in client computing, the data center and memory. With industry-leading products and a strong first half results, we're on a clear path for another record year. \nAs we shared in February and reinforced in April, our strategy is to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. I outlined our top 4 priorities for the year in support of that strategy: growing the data center and adjacencies, ensuring a strong and healthy PC business, growing IoT and devices and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs. \nI'd like to take a few minutes to highlight our progress in Q2. First, DCG. The data center business grew 9% in Q2 and remained on track to high single-digit growth for the year. Strong public cloud growth continued, with revenue up 35%. Enterprise was down 11%, as workloads continue to migrate to the cloud and memory and solid-state drive constraints impacted server deployment. Comms service provider revenue was up 17%, while adjacencies, which serve all customer segments, rose 12%. Cloud and comms service provider together are the growth engine in the data center and together now make up 60% of our DCG revenue. \nIn 5G, we're demonstrating end-to-end leadership in client and infrastructure. We have 5 ongoing trials with leading global service providers and 15 more in the pipeline. And we're on track with our development of IA, FPGA and ASIC silicon platforms based on new radio standards. \nEarlier this month, we launched Xeon Scalable, formerly known as Skylake, and with it the industry's biggest platform advancement in a decade. Using Xeon Scalable, our customers have already achieved over 50 third-party-verified performance world records and are seeing more than 1.6x performance increase over our prior generation product across a wide range of real-world workloads.\nFor example, the new AVX-512 instructions, double floating point performance, benefiting use cases like HPC, VR and AI. In fact, artificial intelligence inference throughput improves by 2.4x gen-to-gen. And when this silicon innovation is combined with our AI software frameworks optimization, customers, like Amazon Web Services, are seeing inference performance for improvement of more than 100x. The enthusiasm for Xeon Scalable resulted in our largest early ship program ever. We delivered more than 500,000 units to over 30 customers who appreciate outright performance leadership. The data center is central to our strategy and is a remarkable opportunity. By 2021, we expect the data center to be a $65 billion silicon opportunity, and we're less than 40% of the total available segment today. \nAs we build out the adjacencies like Ethernet, silicon photonics and 3D XPoint memory and pool them all together with rack scale design, we'll be positioned to deliver even higher levels of performance and efficiency to our customers and increase our percentage of the total TAM. \nThe Client Computing Group also delivered fantastic result.

The Client Computing Group also delivered fantastic result. Revenue was up 12% over last year, as product leadership, combined with a disciplined segmentation strategy, led to rising core mix. We, along with our customers and partners in the PC supply chain, are driving the evolution of the PC experience, as users seek out high performance and new form factors. 
We launched a powerful, new Intel Core X-Series processor family, including a new Core i9 Extreme Edition Processor, extending our performance leadership. And we'll be shipping our first 10-nanometer product near the end of the year, beginning with a lower volume SKU and followed by multiple SKUs and a volume ramp in the first half of 2018. We've seen some modest improvements in the PC consumption, but we continue to expect a mid-single-digit TAM decline for the full year. 
We also began shipping our next-generation 4G LTE modem, known as the 7480, to customers. As I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to make great progress with our wireless ecosystem laying the groundwork for 5G. And starting in 2018, Intel will partner on what is expected to be the first 5G showcase at the Olympic Games. 
In our Internet of Things business, we're focused on 4 key verticals: retail, video, industrial and transportation. We saw strong growth across all 4, leading to a 26% increase in revenue. We're specifically excited to see the ramp of our IVI designs with both Jaguar Land Rover and Toyota. We're also about to mark a very important milestone in our transformation. 
We expect to close the acquisition of Mobileye in the third quarter, several months earlier than expected. Autonomous driving is a massive compute workload that will disrupt industries and save lives, and we are investing to win in this important segment. I'm excited to welcome the Mobileye team to Intel. Together, we expect to be the global leader in the $70 billion autonomous driving system, data and services market opportunity by accelerating auto industry innovation and delivering cloud to car solutions faster and at a lower cost. And we're looking forward to talking with you in more detail about our plan and the progress we're making in the segment later this quarter.
Memory and FPGAs round out our priorities for the year. Our memory business grew 58% over last year, setting an all-time revenue record. A cornerstone for our strategy in this segment is differentiated technology. And that differentiation was on display earlier this month when we announced availability of the industry's first and to date only 64-layer 3D NAND SSDs. Our floating gate architecture already enabled industry-leading density at 32 layers. And we believe our density lead is even greater at 64. 
We also shipped more than 200,000 units of our revolutionary Optane memory for clients, which are available via our OEM partners and channel partners, and have more than 50 data center customers testing Optane SSDs currently, which will ship for revenue this year. Optane DIMMs remaining on track for availability next year. 
Our memory factory, Fab 68, continues to exceed expectations, ramping ahead of schedule in terms of both output and yield. This will be a big part of our overall supply growth in the second half, which we expect to be greater than 20%. The combination of strong execution and favorable market condition is accelerating our path to profitability. Core NAND returned to profitability this quarter, ahead of our earlier estimate, and we expected it to remain profitable for the balance of the year. We also now expect the entire NSG segment to be profitable for the full year of 2018 versus our prior end of 2018 target. 
Lastly, our FPGA business was down 5% over last year on weaker data center and comp sectors but remain on track to our mid-single-digit growth target for the full year with broad re-acceleration in the second half across markets, including the data center segment. At their Build Conference in May, Microsoft disclosed a major advancement in the deployment of Intel FPGAs, resulting in the industry's fastest public cloud network and new technology for acceleration of deep neural networks. Audi selected Intel for the level 3 autonomous driving systems in its upcoming A8, where our Cyclone V SoC FPGA technology will perform object and map fusion as well as parking pilot and sensor data preprocessing. We're also seeing strong adoption of our 14-nanometer Stratix 10 FPGAs. We continue to gain key design wins in our focus segments, and we're on track to production later this year. 
To sum it up, I'm very pleased with our progress, and I'm more confident than ever in Intel's future and growth. Based on our strong first half and higher expectations for the PC business and the expected close of Mobileye, we're raising our full year revenue forecast from $60 billion to $61.3 billion and our non-GAAP EPS forecast from $2.85 to $3. 
We continue to see intense competition across our businesses. That's the reality of the attractive markets in which we participate. The competition makes us stronger, and we're ready for it. We're executing well to our strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. The PC TAM is down more than 15% versus 4 years ago. Despite that headwind, our revenue is up more than 15%, and our operating profit has grown more than 30%. More than 40% of our revenue now comes from our data-centric businesses, outside the PC sector. And those businesses together are growing at double-digit rates. And while we're growing the top line, we're intensely focused on operating efficiency. 
We now expect spending as a percent of revenue to decline about 160 basis points versus last year, bringing it below 34%, on track to the 30% goal we're committed to, to hit by 2020. And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Bob.

          Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon. Like Brian said, we had an outstanding quarter and executed on several important milestones. Revenue was $14.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, excluding the Intel Security Group. From an earnings perspective, operating income was $4.2 billion, up 30% year-over-year, and EPS of $0.72 was up 22% year-over-year. Our EPS performance was the result of strong top line growth, good gross margin improvement and excellent spending leverage. From a capital allocation perspective, we generated $4.7 billion in cash flow from operations, returned $2.6 billion to shareholders and have capital in place to fund the Mobileye acquisition. The planned acquisition of Mobileye, which will fuel our growth in the automotive segment, is expected to close in Q3, well ahead of our schedule. 
At our Analyst Day in February, we talked about our strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, a company well positioned to power the cloud and the billions of smart and connected devices. Our Q2 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation, with the data-centric businesses, those outside of the PC segment, up 16% year-over-year. Our PC-centric business executed extremely well in a declining market and was up 12%. Our data-centric businesses are more than 40% of the company's overall revenue.
Moving to earnings. We are seeing broad growth across the business, driving 4 points of operating margin leverage and 22% EPS growth year-over-year. Earnings growth is driven by strong top line growth for both the PC and data-centric businesses, improving unit cost

Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thanks, Mark. Q2 was an outstanding quarter in which we set a number of records. We beat the expectations we set in April, primarily as a result of stronger desktop and notebook microprocessor volume, and set a second quarter revenue record. We're executing well to our priorities. And after adjusting for the McAfee transaction, revenue grew 14% year-over-year, while non-GAAP operating margin grew 30%. Our data-centric businesses were up 16% year-over-year. \nTechnology and performance leadership are fueling our results. And in Q2, we extended our leadership with new breakthrough products in client computing, the data center and memory. With industry-leading products and a strong first half results, we're on a clear path for another record year. \nAs we shared in February and reinforced in April, our strategy is to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. I outlined our top 4 priorities for the year in support of that strategy: growing the data center and adjacencies, ensuring a strong and healthy PC business, growing IoT and devices and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs. \nI'd like to take a few minutes to highlight our progress in Q2. First, DCG. The data center business grew 9% in Q2 and remained on track to high single-digit growth for the year. Strong public cloud growth continued, with revenue up 35%. Enterprise was down 11%, as workloads continue to migrate to the cloud and memory and solid-state drive constraints impacted server deployment. Comms service provider revenue was up 17%, while adjacencies, which serve all customer segments, rose 12%. Cloud and comms service provider together are the growth engine in the data center and together now make up 60% of our DCG revenue. \nIn 5G, we're demonstrating end-to-end leadership in client and infrastructure. We have 5 ongoing trials with leading global service providers and 15 more in the pipeline. And we're on track with our development of IA, FPGA and ASIC silicon platforms based on new radio standards. \nEarlier this month, we launched Xeon Scalable, formerly known as Skylake, and with it the industry's biggest platform advancement in a decade. Using Xeon Scalable, our customers have already achieved over 50 third-party-verified performance world records and are seeing more than 1.6x performance increase over our prior generation product across a wide range of real-world workloads.\nFor example, the new AVX-512 instructions, double floating point performance, benefiting use cases like HPC, VR and AI. In fact, artificial intelligence inference throughput improves by 2.4x gen-to-gen. And when this silicon innovation is combined with our AI software frameworks optimization, customers, like Amazon Web Services, are seeing inference performance for improvement of more than 100x. The enthusiasm for Xeon Scalable resulted in our largest early ship program ever. We delivered more than 500,000 units to over 30 customers who appreciate outright performance leadership. The data center is central to our strategy and is a remarkable opportunity. By 2021, we expect the data center to be a $65 billion silicon opportunity, and we're less than 40% of the total available segment today. \nAs we build out the adjacencies like Ethernet, silicon photonics and 3D XPoint memory and pool them all together with rack scale design, we'll be positioned to deliver even higher levels of performance and efficiency to our customers and increase our percentage of the total TAM. \nThe Client Computing Group also delivered fantastic result. Revenue was up 12% over last year, as product leadership, combined with a disciplined segmentation strategy, led to rising core mix. We, along with our customers and partners in the PC supply chain, are driving the evolution of the PC experience, as users seek out high performance and new form factors. \nWe launched a powerful, new Intel Core X-Series processor family, including a new Core i9 Extreme Edition Processor, extending our performance leadership.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Mark. Our top-line results for the quarter came in right in line with outlook. And profitability this quarter exceeded our expectations. Year-over-year growth this quarter was 3% overall as we transformed Intel into a Company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected devices. We continue to focus on growth in line with this transformation, as evidenced by results in the data center, IoT and programmable solutions business this quarter. 
I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through these results and their implications. I will start with the Client Computing Group, where we saw a 3% decline in revenue year over year this quarter while operating margin was up 19%. These results were a little better than we expected, as the PC supply chain reduced inventories at a slightly slower rate while the two-in-one and enthusiast product lines continued to grow. We also started shipping our seventh generation core microprocessor, formerly known as Kaby Lake, and our latest LTE modem, known as 7360. 
Next the Data Center, where revenue grew 5% year over year. Cloud service providers grew 9%, comm service providers grew 10%, and enterprise was down 1%. We achieved some critical milestones in the quarter that give us confidence in our growing momentum as we enter the second half of the year. 
In the data center, we're seeing an ongoing preference for performance up and down the pricing stack. Average selling prices increased year over year in every microprocessor product segment, from Adam and Xeon D SOCs at the low end up through Xeon and Xeon Phi at the high end. 
We continued to gain share in network infrastructure throughout the entire segment, as Intel architecture becomes the solution of choice for the transformation of the network to SDN, NFE, and 5G. The significant share gains at the low end of the network infrastructure segment resulted in an overall 1% decline in data center CPU average selling prices. 
Progress in the data center extended beyond our CPU product lines. Our latest Xeon Phi accelerator, formerly known as Knights Landing, continued to ramp after shipping the first limited production units in December of last year. Xeon Phi revenue grew eight times in the first six months of this year versus all of 2015, gaining share in the supercomputing and machine learning segments. 
Omni-Path, our high performance computing fabric, was launched earlier this year and has already achieved 30% market segment share of the 100-gig fabric market. In June's top 500 supercomputing list, Omni-Path was deployed in half of the new 100-gig systems, pointing to the performance that this technology brings to the market. 
This quarter we also shipped our first silicon Photonics products for revenue, the industry's only fully integrated solution. We expect DCG's adjacent product lines, including Omni-Path, Silicon Photonics and ethernet, to collectively grow more than 20% for the full year, and this quarter make up 12% of DCG's revenue. 
The Internet of Things business was up 2% over last year, coming in below our expectations. We saw growth in the industrial and video verticals offset by an inventory burn after a very strong first quarter. We continue to see tremendous potential in this business. 
A great example was demonstrated earlier this month when we announced our autonomous driving collaboration with BMW and Mobileye, marking a significant step for the auto industry as we work together to establish an industry standard, open platform for autonomous driving. In addition we're bringing Indian computing technology to power the next generation of BMW's highly autonomous and fully autonomous products, of the door locks to the data center. 
Our Memory business was down 20% over last year, and fell short of our expectations as a result of a more competitive pricing environment. While we acknowledge the cyclical and competitive nature of this business, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects as a result of the new technologies we're bringing to this market. 
568 in Dalion, China started its initial 3-D NAND wafers late in the second quarter, but ahead of schedule. We also remain on track to ship 3-D Cross Point SSDs, branded Optane, by the end of the year, and look forward to delivering this exciting new breakthrough in memory to the industry. 
The Programmable Solutions Group, formerly known as Altera, delivered great results. PSG grew 12% over Altera's results last year, a strength in [calms], infrastructure and the channel. PSG is on track to ship 14-nanometers, Stratex 10 samples this year. I'm very pleased with both the integration of this business and their strong execution. Our security business was up 10% as a restructuring the team completed last year, and their focused execution continues to deliver results. 
And finally, our restructuring initiative that we began last quarter is solidly on track. This program is changing where and how we invest in everything from research and development to sales and marketing. 
In April we announced some important changes to our roadmaps in areas like SOCs and perceptual computing. These changes are accelerating our transformation to a Company that powers the cloud and the billions of smart, connected computing devices while increasing the profitability in our Client business. In total we expect this initiative will drive in a net run rate OpEx savings of $1.4 billion by mid-2017. 
Looking ahead, I am very excited about the growing momentum heading into the second half of the year. While we remain cautious about the PC segment and continue to expect a decline in the high single digits of this year, we're expecting our businesses outside of CCG to collectively deliver double digit growth in the third quarter. 
We are seeing clear signs that our strategy is working, laying a solid foundation for growth built on the Data Center and the Internet of Things business, reinforced by the combination of Memory and FPGA, and bound together by connectivity. With that, let me turn it over to Stacy.

Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Brian. In the second quarter we met our financial commitments and made good progress towards our restructuring goals. Our forecast reflects growing momentum as we enter the back half of 2016. 
Revenue for the second quarter was $13.5 billion, in line with expectations and up 3% year over year. Gross margin for the quarter of 62% was approximately 1 point higher than our expectations, primarily driven by lower platform unit costs. Spending on R&D and MG&A was $5.2 billion, in line with our expectations. We're on track to the restructuring announcement last earnings call, with a reduction of about 6,000 employees in the second quarter. 
Operating income of $3.2 billion was down 2% from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. Earnings per share of $0.59 was down $0.03 from a year ago. 
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.3 billion, down 3% year over year. Client Computing Group operating profit was $1.9 billion, up 19% from a year ago. This improvement is driven by lower overall spending and margin improvements in our mobile products and higher ASPs in the PC segment. The worldwide PC supply chain inventory levels came down a bit in the second quarter, and as we enter the second half they are at healthy levels. 
Data Center revenue was $4 billion, up 5% year over year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.8 billion, down 4% year over year, primarily driven by increased costs as we ramp 14-nanometer data center products. As we enter the second half we expect the enterprise segment of the business to stabilize and the cloud segment growth rate to accelerate. In addition, we expect increasing ASPs as we ramp our Broadwell-based server products. 
Our Internet of Things segment achieved revenue of $572 million, with year over year growth of 2%. Our security business had revenue of $537 million, up 10% year over year. 
Our Memory business had revenue of $554 million, down 20% year over year. This segment had an operating loss of $224 million as a result of continued pricing pressures, higher startup costs as we ramp 3-D NAND in our China factory, and an increased 3-D Cross Point spending. 
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $465 million, up 12% year over year when compared to Altera's results from a year ago. Operating profit was negative $62 million. This includes about $160 million in non-cash charges for inventory adjustments. Excluding these charges would result in about $100 million in positive operating profit. 
Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $17.7 billion, up $2.6 billion from the first quarter. Our total debt is $28.6 billion. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer term investments, is negative $5.7 billion. We're projecting to improve this net cash balance over the second half of the year. 
We are generating healthy levels of free cash flow, which enable us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. This is demonstrated in our Q2 results, as we generated $3.8 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter, purchased $2.3 billion in capital assets and repurchased approximately $800 million of stock. In the second quarter we also paid $1.2 billion in dividends. And as of yesterday's close of market our dividend yield was about 3%. 
As we look forward to the third quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.9 billion. This forecast is at the high end of the average seasonal increase for the third quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 62%. 
Turning to the full year 2016, we expect revenue growth in the mid single digits. We continue to expect the overall PC market to be down in the high single digits, and we expect to achieve low double digit growth in our Data Center business. Gross margin for the full year 2016 is expected to be 62%, consistent with our prior outlook. 
You can see our strategy playing out in our first-half results and our expectations for the second half. We expect above seasonal growth in the back half of the year led by strong growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things and Memory businesses. And for the year we expect that growth in those business will offset the PC market decline, and with the addition of the Programmable Solutions Group, will result in mid-single digit revenue growth. 
Additionally, we're executing to our restructuring program, which allows us to increase investments in strategically important areas, generate financial returns for our owners, and build the foundation for future financial growth. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.

Welcome to the Intel Corporation second-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. \n(Operator Instructions) \nAs a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Henninger. You may begin. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Henninger,  Intel Corporation - VP of Finance & Director of IR    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank you, and welcome everyone to Intel's second-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. \nI'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO, and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment we will hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A. \nBefore we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. \nAlso if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our website, intc.com. With that, let me hand it over to Brian. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks, Mark. Our top-line results for the quarter came in right in line with outlook. And profitability this quarter exceeded our expectations. Year-over-year growth this quarter was 3% overall as we transformed Intel into a Company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected devices. We continue to focus on growth in line with this transformation, as evidenced by results in the data center, IoT and programmable solutions business this quarter. \nI'd like to take a few minutes to walk through these results and their implications. I will start with the Client Computing Group, where we saw a 3% decline in revenue year over year this quarter while operating margin was up 19%. These results were a little better than we expected, as the PC supply chain reduced inventories at a slightly slower rate while the two-in-one and enthusiast product lines continued to grow. We also started shipping our seventh generation core microprocessor, formerly known as Kaby Lake, and our latest LTE modem, known as 7360. \nNext the Data Center, where revenue grew 5% year over year. Cloud service providers grew 9%, comm service providers grew 10%, and enterprise was down 1%. We achieved some critical milestones in the quarter that give us confidence in our growing momentum as we enter the second half of the year. \nIn the data center, we're seeing an ongoing preference for performance up and down the pricing stack. Average selling prices increased year over year in every microprocessor product segment, from Adam and Xeon D SOCs at the low end up through Xeon and Xeon Phi at the high end. \nWe continued to gain share in network infrastructure throughout the entire segment, as Intel architecture becomes the solution of choice for the transformation of the network to SDN, NFE, and 5G. The significant share gains at the low end of the network infrastructure segment resulted in an overall 1% decline in data center CPU average selling prices. \nProgress in the data center extended beyond our CPU product lines. Our latest Xeon Phi accelerator, formerly known as Knights Landing, continued to ramp after shipping the first limited production units in December of last year. Xeon Phi revenue grew eight times in the first six months of this year versus all of 2015, gaining share in the supercomputing and machine learning segments. \nOmni-Path, our high performance computing fabric, was launched earlier this year and has already achieved 30% market segment share of the 100-gig fabric market. In June's top 500 supercomputing list, Omni-Path was deployed in half of the new 100-gig systems, pointing to the performance that this technology brings to the market. \nThis quarter we also shipped our first silicon Photonics products for revenue, the industry's only fully integrated solution. We expect DCG's adjacent product lines, including Omni-Path, Silicon Photonics and ethernet, to collectively grow more than 20% for the full year, and this quarter make up 12% of DCG's revenue. \nThe Internet of Things business was up 2% over last year, coming in below our expectations. We saw growth in the industrial and video verticals offset by an inventory burn after a very strong first quarter. We continue to see tremendous potential in this business. \nA great example was demonstrated earlier this month when we announced our autonomous driving collaboration with BMW and Mobileye, marking a significant step for the auto industry as we work together to establish an industry standard, open platform for autonomous driving. In addition we're bringing Indian computing technology to power the next generation of BMW's highly autonomous and fully autonomous products, of the door locks to the data center. \nOur Memory business was down 20% over last year, and fell short of our expectations as a result of a more competitive pricing environment. While we acknowledge the cyclical and competitive nature of this business, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects as a result of the new technologies we're bringing to this market. \n568 in Dalion, China started its initial 3-D NAND wafers late in the second quarter, but ahead of schedule. We also remain on track to ship 3-D Cross Point SSDs, branded Optane, by the end of the year, and look forward to delivering this exciting new breakthrough in memory to the industry. \nThe Programmable Solutions Group, formerly known as Altera, delivered great results. PSG grew 12% over Altera's results last year, a strength in [calms], infrastructure and the channel. PSG is on track to ship 14-nanometers, Stratex 10 samples this year. I'm very pleased with both the integration of this business and their strong execution. Our security business was up 10% as a restructuring the team completed last year, and their focused execution continues to deliver results. \nAnd finally, our restructuring initiative that we began last quarter is solidly on track. This program is changing where and how we invest in everything from research and development to sales and marketing. \nIn April we announced some important changes to our roadmaps in areas like SOCs and perceptual computing. These changes are accelerating our transformation to a Company that powers the cloud and the billions of smart, connected computing devices while increasing the profitability in our Client business. In total we expect this initiative will drive in a net run rate OpEx savings of $1.4 billion by mid-2017. \nLooking ahead, I am very excited about the growing momentum heading into the second half of the year.

These changes are accelerating our transformation to a Company that powers the cloud and the billions of smart, connected computing devices while increasing the profitability in our Client business. In total we expect this initiative will drive in a net run rate OpEx savings of $1.4 billion by mid-2017. 
Looking ahead, I am very excited about the growing momentum heading into the second half of the year. While we remain cautious about the PC segment and continue to expect a decline in the high single digits of this year, we're expecting our businesses outside of CCG to collectively deliver double digit growth in the third quarter. 
We are seeing clear signs that our strategy is working, laying a solid foundation for growth built on the Data Center and the Internet of Things business, reinforced by the combination of Memory and FPGA, and bound together by connectivity. With that, let me turn it over to Stacy.

Thanks, Brian. In the second quarter we met our financial commitments and made good progress towards our restructuring goals. Our forecast reflects growing momentum as we enter the back half of 2016. 
Revenue for the second quarter was $13.5 billion, in line with expectations and up 3% year over year. Gross margin for the quarter of 62% was approximately 1 point higher than our expectations, primarily driven by lower platform unit costs. Spending on R&D and MG&A was $5.2 billion, in line with our expectations. We're on track to the restructuring announcement last earnings call, with a reduction of about 6,000 employees in the second quarter. 
Operating income of $3.2 billion was down 2% from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. Earnings per share of $0.59 was down $0.03 from a year ago. 
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.3 billion, down 3% year over year. Client Computing Group operating profit was $1.9 billion, up 19% from a year ago. This improvement is driven by lower overall spending and margin improvements in our mobile products and higher ASPs in the PC segment. The worldwide PC supply chain inventory levels came down a bit in the second quarter, and as we enter the second half they are at healthy levels. 
Data Center revenue was $4 billion, up 5% year over year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.8 billion, down 4% year over year, primarily driven by increased costs as we ramp 14-nanometer data center products. As we enter the second half we expect the enterprise segment of the business to stabilize and the cloud segment growth rate to accelerate. In addition, we expect increasing ASPs as we ramp our Broadwell-based server products. 
Our Internet of Things segment achieved revenue of $572 million, with year over year growth of 2%. Our security business had revenue of $537 million, up 10% year over year. 
Our Memory business had revenue of $554 million, down 20% year over year. This segment had an operating loss of $224 million as a result of continued pricing pressures, higher startup costs as we ramp 3-D NAND in our China factory, and an increased 3-D Cross Point spending. 
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $465 million, up 12% year over year when compared to Altera's results from a year ago. Operating profit was negative $62 million. This includes about $160 million in non-cash charges for inventory adjustments. Excluding these charges would result in about $100 million in positive operating profit. 
Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $17.7 billion, up $2.6 billion from the first quarter. Our total debt is $28.6 billion. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer term investments, is negative $5.7 billion. We're projecting to improve this net cash balance over the second half of the year. 
We are generating healthy levels of free cash flow, which enable us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. This is demonstrated in our Q2 results, as we generated $3.8 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter, purchased $2.3 billion in capital assets and repurchased approximately $800 million of stock. In the second quarter we also paid $1.2 billion in dividends. And as of yesterday's close of market our dividend yield was about 3%. 
As we look forward to the third quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.9 billion. This forecast is at the high end of the average seasonal increase for the third quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 62%. 
Turning to the full year 2016, we expect revenue growth in the mid single digits. We continue to expect the overall PC market to be down in the high single digits, and we expect to achieve low double digit growth in our Data Center business. Gross margin for the full year 2016 is expected to be 62%, consistent with our prior outlook. 
You can see our strategy playing out in our first-half results and our expectations for the second half. We expect above seasonal growth in the back half of the year led by strong growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things and Memory businesses. And for the year we expect that growth in those business will offset the PC market decline, and with the addition of the Programmable Solutions Group, will result in mid-single digit revenue growth. 
Additionally, we're executing to our restructuring program, which allows us to increase investments in strategically important areas, generate financial returns for our owners, and build the foundation for future financial growth. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.

Welcome to the Intel Corporation second-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. \n(Operator Instructions) \nAs a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Henninger. You may begin. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Henninger,  Intel Corporation - VP of Finance & Director of IR    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank you, and welcome everyone to Intel's second-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. \nI'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO, and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment we will hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A. \nBefore we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. \nAlso if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our website, intc.com. With that, let me hand it over to Brian. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks, Mark. Our top-line results for the quarter came in right in line with outlook. And profitability this quarter exceeded our expectations. Year-over-year growth this quarter was 3% overall as we transformed Intel into a Company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected devices. We continue to focus on growth in line with this transformation, as evidenced by results in the data center, IoT and programmable solutions business this quarter. \nI'd like to take a few minutes to walk through these results and their implications. I will start with the Client Computing Group, where we saw a 3% decline in revenue year over year this quarter while operating margin was up 19%. These results were a little better than we expected, as the PC supply chain reduced inventories at a slightly slower rate while the two-in-one and enthusiast product lines continued to grow. We also started shipping our seventh generation core microprocessor, formerly known as Kaby Lake, and our latest LTE modem, known as 7360. \nNext the Data Center, where revenue grew 5% year over year. Cloud service providers grew 9%, comm service providers grew 10%, and enterprise was down 1%. We achieved some critical milestones in the quarter that give us confidence in our growing momentum as we enter the second half of the year. \nIn the data center, we're seeing an ongoing preference for performance up and down the pricing stack. Average selling prices increased year over year in every microprocessor product segment, from Adam and Xeon D SOCs at the low end up through Xeon and Xeon Phi at the high end. \nWe continued to gain share in network infrastructure throughout the entire segment, as Intel architecture becomes the solution of choice for the transformation of the network to SDN, NFE, and 5G. The significant share gains at the low end of the network infrastructure segment resulted in an overall 1% decline in data center CPU average selling prices. \nProgress in the data center extended beyond our CPU product lines. Our latest Xeon Phi accelerator, formerly known as Knights Landing, continued to ramp after shipping the first limited production units in December of last year. Xeon Phi revenue grew eight times in the first six months of this year versus all of 2015, gaining share in the supercomputing and machine learning segments. \nOmni-Path, our high performance computing fabric, was launched earlier this year and has already achieved 30% market segment share of the 100-gig fabric market. In June's top 500 supercomputing list, Omni-Path was deployed in half of the new 100-gig systems, pointing to the performance that this technology brings to the market. \nThis quarter we also shipped our first silicon Photonics products for revenue, the industry's only fully integrated solution. We expect DCG's adjacent product lines, including Omni-Path, Silicon Photonics and ethernet, to collectively grow more than 20% for the full year, and this quarter make up 12% of DCG's revenue. \nThe Internet of Things business was up 2% over last year, coming in below our expectations. We saw growth in the industrial and video verticals offset by an inventory burn after a very strong first quarter. We continue to see tremendous potential in this business. \nA great example was demonstrated earlier this month when we announced our autonomous driving collaboration with BMW and Mobileye, marking a significant step for the auto industry as we work together to establish an industry standard, open platform for autonomous driving. In addition we're bringing Indian computing technology to power the next generation of BMW's highly autonomous and fully autonomous products, of the door locks to the data center. \nOur Memory business was down 20% over last year, and fell short of our expectations as a result of a more competitive pricing environment. While we acknowledge the cyclical and competitive nature of this business, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects as a result of the new technologies we're bringing to this market. \n568 in Dalion, China started its initial 3-D NAND wafers late in the second quarter, but ahead of schedule. We also remain on track to ship 3-D Cross Point SSDs, branded Optane, by the end of the year, and look forward to delivering this exciting new breakthrough in memory to the industry. \nThe Programmable Solutions Group, formerly known as Altera, delivered great results. PSG grew 12% over Altera's results last year, a strength in [calms], infrastructure and the channel. PSG is on track to ship 14-nanometers, Stratex 10 samples this year. I'm very pleased with both the integration of this business and their strong execution. Our security business was up 10% as a restructuring the team completed last year, and their focused execution continues to deliver results. \nAnd finally, our restructuring initiative that we began last quarter is solidly on track. This program is changing where and how we invest in everything from research and development to sales and marketing. \nIn April we announced some important changes to our roadmaps in areas like SOCs and perceptual computing. These changes are accelerating our transformation to a Company that powers the cloud and the billions of smart, connected computing devices while increasing the profitability in our Client business. In total we expect this initiative will drive in a net run rate OpEx savings of $1.4 billion by mid-2017. \nLooking ahead, I am very excited about the growing momentum heading into the second half of the year. While we remain cautious about the PC segment and continue to expect a decline in the high single digits of this year, we're expecting our businesses outside of CCG to collectively deliver double digit growth in the third quarter. \nWe are seeing clear signs that our strategy is working, laying a solid foundation for growth built on the Data Center and the Internet of Things business, reinforced by the combination of Memory and FPGA, and bound together by connectivity. With that, let me turn it over to Stacy. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks, Brian. In the second quarter we met our financial commitments and made good progress towards our restructuring goals.

Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Interim CEO, Executive VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Mark. Our results for the quarter were outstanding, marking a record second quarter on our way to what we expect will be a record 2018. Last week, we celebrated Intel's 50th year as a company, which is a big deal in an industry that never stops evolving. Even more remarkable is that after 5 decades in tech, Intel is poised to deliver its third year in a row of record financial performance. 
We set a course 5 years ago to transform the company. To do that, we made investments to enhance and extend our core microprocessor business along with a series of bold bets to compete and win in new markets. Our thesis was that Intel is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the world's insatiable need to process, store and move data. The results have been dramatic. We are now competing for a $260 billion TAM, the largest in the company's history, and we have lots of room to grow. 
Just 5 years ago, roughly 1/3 of our revenue was data-centric. Today, nearly 1/2 of our revenue is data-centric and growing at a double-digit rate. Data has never been more pervasive nor more valuable. In fact, 90% of the digital data ever created was generated in just the past 2 years. But of that data, only 1% has been analyzed, indicating massive untapped potential. 
I'd like to highlight a few indicators of Intel's accelerating transformation before going into our financial results. 
First, in our data center business, our focus on the cloud, network transformation and AI and analytics produced outstanding results in a strong demand environment. Customer preference for our highest performance products continued, with Xeon Scalable at nearly 50% of our mix in the second quarter. 
Cloud revenue grew as service provider CapEx continue to accelerate to meet the explosive demand for digital services, artificial intelligence and data analytics. Enterprise revenue is driven by a combination of macro strength and companies' increasing deployment of hybrid cloud solutions and data-intensive workloads. 
In the comms service providers segment, we continue to gain share as customers choose to virtualize and transform their networks and prepare for the 5G transition using Intel Architecture. 
Our Programmable Solutions Group also delivered strong results this quarter. PSG again set a record for design win volumes, indicating customers' confidence in our road map and growing adoption of FPGAs for workload acceleration from the data center through the network and out to the edge. 
Earlier this month, we announced the planned acquisition of eASIC, which will give us a competitive differentiator and another solution to meet customers' diverse time-to-market performance, cost and power needs. 
We combined Intel and Altera 2.5 years ago and we expected a key value driver to be the increasing use of FPGAs in the data center. In Q2, PSG's data center business more than doubled for the second consecutive quarter. 
IoTG set an all-time revenue record with particular strength in the retail and industrial sectors as customers look to Intel not only for compute performance, but for solutions that drive business value. We also completed the sale of Wind River as we continue to redeploy resources to higher growth and return areas. 
Building on this industry leadership in ADAS and driving the industry toward an autonomous future, Mobileye set another all-time revenue record. Customer momentum continued with several design wins, including a multimillion unit deal with ZF for a large global automaker. 
We also announced that Baidu has adopted Mobileye's EyeQ base surround computer vision kit as the preferred vision solution for commercial Apollo pilot AV deployment. In both the open source and commercial Apollo programs, Baidu will also integrate Mobileye's responsibility sensitive safety model, an open and transparent model that provides safety assurance for AV decision-making, an industry imperative. 
Our memory business also set an all-time revenue record. We are transforming the memory industry with a pair of differentiated platform-connected capabilities, high-density Floating Gate 3D NAND and high-performance persistent Optane technology. 
We've recently announced that we are in production on the industry's first 4 bits per cell data center NAND PCIe SSDs. And at the same time, industry support for Intel Optane DC persistent memory continues to grow with technology leaders, including CERN, Google, SAP and Tencent already announcing plans for future use of the technology. Unlike traditional DRAM, Intel Optane DC persistent memory will offer the unprecedented combination of high capacity, up to 3 terabytes per socket, along with affordability and persistence. 
Intel and Micron recently announced that we will develop future generations of 3D XPoint technology independently to better align the technology to our individual business needs and strategy. We'll continue to jointly manufacture 3D XPoint at the Intel Micron flash technology fab in Lehi. 
Intel intends to extend its leadership with Intel Optane products based on 3D XPoint, which, combined with our high-density 3D NAND technology, offer the best solution for today's computing and storage needs. 
And finally, in client computing, our focus on innovation and differentiation in the commercial, enthusiast and fin and light segments is producing results. Overall market conditions also continue to improve, and we now expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year for the first time since 2011. 
The commercial segment remains strong as CIOs refreshing aging PC fleets are turning to Intel Core processors with vPro as the gold standard for performance and manageability. 
At the same time, consumer interest in gaming and our outright performance leadership are driving strength in the enthusiast segment, producing another outstanding quarter in gaming. These trends reflect the market's demand for our highest performance products, resulting in strong overall product mix in CCG. 
We also began shipping the 7560 modem, Intel's first CDMA and first multi-SIM capable modem. 
Our industry-leading products continue to deliver outstanding results. We have a leadership 14-nanometer product lineup for 2019 and we continue to make progress on 10-nanometer. Yields are improving consistent with the time line we shared in April and we expect systems on shelves for the 2019 holiday season. 
In the second quarter, we announced the CEO change. The board is making good progress determining the best person to be the next CEO of this great company. While there is no timetable, the board is working with a sense of urgency and the identification of candidates, both internal and external, is well underway. 
Personally, and on behalf of Intel's 100,000-plus employees, I'd like to thank Brian for his many contributions to the company over his 35-year career. The investments he made set us on a course for transformation. Even more importantly, he developed the right strategy and leadership team to carry that transformation forward while we conduct the CEO search. Our financial results in the second quarter show we're doing just that. Let's turn to the numbers. 
Revenue of $17 billion was up 15% year-over-year, marking a second record quarter. We saw strong performance across all of our businesses and record revenue in NSG, IoTG and Mobileye. Our data-centric businesses were collectively up 26%. Excellent operating margin leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in EPS of $1.04, up 44% year-on-year, even as we continue to invest for growth. 
From a capital allocation perspective, year-to-date we have generated $6.3 billion of free cash flow, returned $8.6 billion to shareholders, including $2.8 billion in dividends and $5.8 billion in buybacks, repurchasing 117 million shares. 
As a result of the continued strength we are seeing in the business, we are raising our full year revenue guide by $2 billion to $69.5 billion. We are also raising our EPS guide by $0.30 versus April to $4.15, and the free cash flow guide by $0.5 billion to $15 billion. 
Our leadership products are winning in an expanded TAM and our data-centric businesses are now almost 50% of our total revenue. Our data-centric businesses had strong quarters, with each business individually growing at a double-digit rate. Our PC-centric business was up 6% on strength in the commercial and enthusiast segments. 
Q2 was another quarter of significant EPS growth, up 44% year-on-year. And our operating margin expanded $1.4 billion and 5 points year-on-year. Our EPS improvement was driven by growing demand for high-performance products in the data center and client businesses, leading to higher volumes and ASPs, strong growth in our adjacent businesses and lower tax rate and lower share count as a result of buybacks. 
In January, we pulled in our 30% spending goal for 2018, a full 2 years ahead of schedule. We are on track to meet that target and our operating efficiency continues to improve. We remain extremely diligent in managing spending while prioritizing investments in areas that will accelerate revenue growth, product leadership, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. This focused approach is producing results. 
Total Q2 spending came in at $5.1 billion, 30% of revenue. Total spending as a percentage of revenue is down 4.6 points year-over-year in the quarter while we continue to increase investment in our key priorities. Versus the second quarter of last year, we delivered $2.2 billion more revenue with no incremental spending. Let's talk now about our Q2 performance by segment. 
The Data Center Group delivered another great double-digit growth quarter with revenue of $5.5 billion, up 27% year-over-year and operating income of $2.7 billion, up 65%. Q2 operating margin was 49%, and we continued to see strong growth in both the cloud and comms service providers segments, which now make up 2/3 of DCG revenue. 
Platform unit volume was up 14% and ASPs were up 11%. Non-CPU adjacencies grew 30% over last year, yet another indic

Swan,  Intel Corporation - Interim CEO, Executive VP & CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thanks, Mark. Our results for the quarter were outstanding, marking a record second quarter on our way to what we expect will be a record 2018. Last week, we celebrated Intel's 50th year as a company, which is a big deal in an industry that never stops evolving. Even more remarkable is that after 5 decades in tech, Intel is poised to deliver its third year in a row of record financial performance. \nWe set a course 5 years ago to transform the company. To do that, we made investments to enhance and extend our core microprocessor business along with a series of bold bets to compete and win in new markets. Our thesis was that Intel is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the world's insatiable need to process, store and move data. The results have been dramatic. We are now competing for a $260 billion TAM, the largest in the company's history, and we have lots of room to grow. \nJust 5 years ago, roughly 1/3 of our revenue was data-centric. Today, nearly 1/2 of our revenue is data-centric and growing at a double-digit rate. Data has never been more pervasive nor more valuable. In fact, 90% of the digital data ever created was generated in just the past 2 years. But of that data, only 1% has been analyzed, indicating massive untapped potential. \nI'd like to highlight a few indicators of Intel's accelerating transformation before going into our financial results. \nFirst, in our data center business, our focus on the cloud, network transformation and AI and analytics produced outstanding results in a strong demand environment. Customer preference for our highest performance products continued, with Xeon Scalable at nearly 50% of our mix in the second quarter. \nCloud revenue grew as service provider CapEx continue to accelerate to meet the explosive demand for digital services, artificial intelligence and data analytics. Enterprise revenue is driven by a combination of macro strength and companies' increasing deployment of hybrid cloud solutions and data-intensive workloads. \nIn the comms service providers segment, we continue to gain share as customers choose to virtualize and transform their networks and prepare for the 5G transition using Intel Architecture. \nOur Programmable Solutions Group also delivered strong results this quarter. PSG again set a record for design win volumes, indicating customers' confidence in our road map and growing adoption of FPGAs for workload acceleration from the data center through the network and out to the edge. \nEarlier this month, we announced the planned acquisition of eASIC, which will give us a competitive differentiator and another solution to meet customers' diverse time-to-market performance, cost and power needs. \nWe combined Intel and Altera 2.5 years ago and we expected a key value driver to be the increasing use of FPGAs in the data center. In Q2, PSG's data center business more than doubled for the second consecutive quarter. \nIoTG set an all-time revenue record with particular strength in the retail and industrial sectors as customers look to Intel not only for compute performance, but for solutions that drive business value. We also completed the sale of Wind River as we continue to redeploy resources to higher growth and return areas. \nBuilding on this industry leadership in ADAS and driving the industry toward an autonomous future, Mobileye set another all-time revenue record. Customer momentum continued with several design wins, including a multimillion unit deal with ZF for a large global automaker. \nWe also announced that Baidu has adopted Mobileye's EyeQ base surround computer vision kit as the preferred vision solution for commercial Apollo pilot AV deployment. In both the open source and commercial Apollo programs, Baidu will also integrate Mobileye's responsibility sensitive safety model, an open and transparent model that provides safety assurance for AV decision-making, an industry imperative. \nOur memory business also set an all-time revenue record. We are transforming the memory industry with a pair of differentiated platform-connected capabilities, high-density Floating Gate 3D NAND and high-performance persistent Optane technology. \nWe've recently announced that we are in production on the industry's first 4 bits per cell data center NAND PCIe SSDs. And at the same time, industry support for Intel Optane DC persistent memory continues to grow with technology leaders, including CERN, Google, SAP and Tencent already announcing plans for future use of the technology. Unlike traditional DRAM, Intel Optane DC persistent memory will offer the unprecedented combination of high capacity, up to 3 terabytes per socket, along with affordability and persistence. \nIntel and Micron recently announced that we will develop future generations of 3D XPoint technology independently to better align the technology to our individual business needs and strategy. We'll continue to jointly manufacture 3D XPoint at the Intel Micron flash technology fab in Lehi. \nIntel intends to extend its leadership with Intel Optane products based on 3D XPoint, which, combined with our high-density 3D NAND technology, offer the best solution for today's computing and storage needs. \nAnd finally, in client computing, our focus on innovation and differentiation in the commercial, enthusiast and fin and light segments is producing results. Overall market conditions also continue to improve, and we now expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year for the first time since 2011. \nThe commercial segment remains strong as CIOs refreshing aging PC fleets are turning to Intel Core processors with vPro as the gold standard for performance and manageability. \nAt the same time, consumer interest in gaming and our outright performance leadership are driving strength in the enthusiast segment, producing another outstanding quarter in gaming. These trends reflect the market's demand for our highest performance products, resulting in strong overall product mix in CCG. \nWe also began shipping the 7560 modem, Intel's first CDMA and first multi-SIM capable modem. \nOur industry-leading products continue to deliver outstanding results. We have a leadership 14-nanometer product lineup for 2019 and we continue to make progress on 10-nanometer. Yields are improving consistent with the time line we shared in April and we expect systems on shelves for the 2019 holiday season. \nIn the second quarter, we announced the CEO change. The board is making good progress determining the best person to be the next CEO of this great company. While there is no timetable, the board is working with a sense of urgency and the identification of candidates, both internal and external, is well underway. \nPersonally, and on behalf of Intel's 100,000-plus employees, I'd like to thank Brian for his many contributions to the company over his 35-year career. The investments he made set us on a course for transformation. Even more importantly, he developed the right strategy and leadership team to carry that transformation forward while we conduct the CEO search. Our financial results in the second quarter show we're doing just that. Let's turn to the numbers. \nRevenue of $17 billion was up 15% year-over-year, marking a second record quarter. We saw strong performance across all of our businesses and record revenue in NSG, IoTG and Mobileye. Our data-centric businesses were collectively up 26%. Excellent operating margin leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in EPS of $1.04, up 44% year-on-year, even as we continue to invest for growth. \nFrom a capital allocation perspective, year-to-date we have generated $6.3 billion of free cash flow, returned $8.6 billion to shareholders, including $2.8 billion in dividends and $5.8 billion in buybacks, repurchasing 117 million shares. \nAs a result of the continued strength we are seeing in the business, we are raising our full year revenue guide by $2 billion to $69.5 billion. We are also raising our EPS guide by $0.30 versus April to $4.15, and the free cash flow guide by $0.5 billion to $15 billion. \nOur leadership products are winning in an expanded TAM and our data-centric businesses are now almost 50% of our total revenue. Our data-centric businesses had strong quarters, with each business individually growing at a double-digit rate. Our PC-centric business was up 6% on strength in the commercial and enthusiast segments. \nQ2 was another quarter of significant EPS growth, up 44% year-on-year.

We are on track to meet that target and our operating efficiency continues to improve. We remain extremely diligent in managing spending while prioritizing investments in areas that will accelerate revenue growth, product leadership, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. This focused approach is producing results. \nTotal Q2 spending came in at $5.1 billion, 30% of revenue.

Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Interim CEO, Executive VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Mark. Our results for the quarter were outstanding, marking a record second quarter on our way to what we expect will be a record 2018. Last week, we celebrated Intel's 50th year as a company, which is a big deal in an industry that never stops evolving. Even more remarkable is that after 5 decades in tech, Intel is poised to deliver its third year in a row of record financial performance. 
We set a course 5 years ago to transform the company. To do that, we made investments to enhance and extend our core microprocessor business along with a series of bold bets to compete and win in new markets. Our thesis was that Intel is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the world's insatiable need to process, store and move data. The results have been dramatic. We are now competing for a $260 billion TAM, the largest in the company's history, and we have lots of room to grow. 
Just 5 years ago, roughly 1/3 of our revenue was data-centric. Today, nearly 1/2 of our revenue is data-centric and growing at a double-digit rate. Data has never been more pervasive nor more valuable. In fact, 90% of the digital data ever created was generated in just the past 2 years. But of that data, only 1% has been analyzed, indicating massive untapped potential. 
I'd like to highlight a few indicators of Intel's accelerating transformation before going into our financial results. 
First, in our data center business, our focus on the cloud, network transformation and AI and analytics produced outstanding results in a strong demand environment. Customer preference for our highest performance products continued, with Xeon Scalable at nearly 50% of our mix in the second quarter. 
Cloud revenue grew as service provider CapEx continue to accelerate to meet the explosive demand for digital services, artificial intelligence and data analytics. Enterprise revenue is driven by a combination of macro strength and companies' increasing deployment of hybrid cloud solutions and data-intensive workloads. 
In the comms service providers segment, we continue to gain share as customers choose to virtualize and transform their networks and prepare for the 5G transition using Intel Architecture. 
Our Programmable Solutions Group also delivered strong results this quarter. PSG again set a record for design win volumes, indicating customers' confidence in our road map and growing adoption of FPGAs for workload acceleration from the data center through the network and out to the edge. 
Earlier this month, we announced the planned acquisition of eASIC, which will give us a competitive differentiator and another solution to meet customers' diverse time-to-market performance, cost and power needs. 
We combined Intel and Altera 2.5 years ago and we expected a key value driver to be the increasing use of FPGAs in the data center. In Q2, PSG's data center business more than doubled for the second consecutive quarter. 
IoTG set an all-time revenue record with particular strength in the retail and industrial sectors as customers look to Intel not only for compute performance, but for solutions that drive business value. We also completed the sale of Wind River as we continue to redeploy resources to higher growth and return areas. 
Building on this industry leadership in ADAS and driving the industry toward an autonomous future, Mobileye set another all-time revenue record. Customer momentum continued with several design wins, including a multimillion unit deal with ZF for a large global automaker. 
We also announced that Baidu has adopted Mobileye's EyeQ base surround computer vision kit as the preferred vision solution for commercial Apollo pilot AV deployment. In both the open source and commercial Apollo programs, Baidu will also integrate Mobileye's responsibility sensitive safety model, an open and transparent model that provides safety assurance for AV decision-making, an industry imperative. 
Our memory business also set an all-time revenue record. We are transforming the memory industry with a pair of differentiated platform-connected capabilities, high-density Floating Gate 3D NAND and high-performance persistent Optane technology. 
We've recently announced that we are in production on the industry's first 4 bits per cell data center NAND PCIe SSDs. And at the same time, industry support for Intel Optane DC persistent memory continues to grow with technology leaders, including CERN, Google, SAP and Tencent already announcing plans for future use of the technology. Unlike traditional DRAM, Intel Optane DC persistent memory will offer the unprecedented combination of high capacity, up to 3 terabytes per socket, along with affordability and persistence. 
Intel and Micron recently announced that we will develop future generations of 3D XPoint technology independently to better align the technology to our individual business needs and strategy. We'll continue to jointly manufacture 3D XPoint at the Intel Micron flash technology fab in Lehi. 
Intel intends to extend its leadership with Intel Optane products based on 3D XPoint, which, combined with our high-density 3D NAND technology, offer the best solution for today's computing and storage needs. 
And finally, in client computing, our focus on innovation and differentiation in the commercial, enthusiast and fin and light segments is producing results. Overall market conditions also continue to improve, and we now expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year for the first time since 2011. 
The commercial segment remains strong as CIOs refreshing aging PC fleets are turning to Intel Core processors with vPro as the gold standard for performance and manageability. 
At the same time, consumer interest in gaming and our outright performance leadership are driving strength in the enthusiast segment, producing another outstanding quarter in gaming. These trends reflect the market's demand for our highest performance products, resulting in strong overall product mix in CCG. 
We also began shipping the 7560 modem, Intel's first CDMA and first multi-SIM capable modem.

From a capital allocation perspective, year-to-date we have generated $6.3 billion of free cash flow, returned $8.6 billion to shareholders, including $2.8 billion in dividends and $5.8 billion in buybacks, repurchasing 117 million shares. 
As a result of the continued strength we are seeing in the business, we are raising our full year revenue guide by $2 billion to $69.5 billion. We are also raising our EPS guide by $0.30 versus April to $4.15, and the free cash flow guide by $0.5 billion to $15 billion. 
Our leadership products are winning in an expanded TAM and our data-centric businesses are now almost 50% of our total revenue. Our data-centric businesses had strong quarters, with each business individually growing at a double-digit rate. Our PC-centric business was up 6% on strength in the commercial and enthusiast segments. 
Q2 was another quarter of significant EPS growth, up 44% year-on-year. And our operating margin expanded $1.4 billion and 5 points year-on-year. Our EPS improvement was driven by growing demand for high-performance products in the data center and client businesses, leading to higher volumes and ASPs, strong growth in our adjacent businesses and lower tax rate and lower share count as a result of buybacks. 
In January, we pulled in our 30% spending goal for 2018, a full 2 years ahead of schedule. We are on track to meet that target and our operating efficiency continues to improve. We remain extremely diligent in managing spending while prioritizing investments in areas that will accelerate revenue growth, product leadership, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. This focused approach is producing results. 
Total Q2 spending came in at $5.1 billion, 30% of revenue. Total spending as a percentage of revenue is down 4.6 points year-over-year in the quarter while we continue to increase investment in our key priorities. Versus the second quarter of last year, we delivered $2.2 billion more revenue with no incremental spending. Let's talk now about our Q2 performance by segment. 
The Data Center Group delivered another great double-digit growth quarter with revenue of $5.5 billion, up 27% year-over-year and operating income of $2.7 billion, up 65%. Q2 operating margin was 49%, and we continued to see strong growth in both the cloud and comms service providers segments, which now make up 2/3 of DCG revenue.

Swan,  Intel Corporation - Interim CEO, Executive VP & CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thanks, Mark. Our results for the quarter were outstanding, marking a record second quarter on our way to what we expect will be a record 2018. Last week, we celebrated Intel's 50th year as a company, which is a big deal in an industry that never stops evolving. Even more remarkable is that after 5 decades in tech, Intel is poised to deliver its third year in a row of record financial performance. \nWe set a course 5 years ago to transform the company. To do that, we made investments to enhance and extend our core microprocessor business along with a series of bold bets to compete and win in new markets. Our thesis was that Intel is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the world's insatiable need to process, store and move data. The results have been dramatic. We are now competing for a $260 billion TAM, the largest in the company's history, and we have lots of room to grow. \nJust 5 years ago, roughly 1/3 of our revenue was data-centric. Today, nearly 1/2 of our revenue is data-centric and growing at a double-digit rate. Data has never been more pervasive nor more valuable. In fact, 90% of the digital data ever created was generated in just the past 2 years. But of that data, only 1% has been analyzed, indicating massive untapped potential. \nI'd like to highlight a few indicators of Intel's accelerating transformation before going into our financial results. \nFirst, in our data center business, our focus on the cloud, network transformation and AI and analytics produced outstanding results in a strong demand environment. Customer preference for our highest performance products continued, with Xeon Scalable at nearly 50% of our mix in the second quarter. \nCloud revenue grew as service provider CapEx continue to accelerate to meet the explosive demand for digital services, artificial intelligence and data analytics. Enterprise revenue is driven by a combination of macro strength and companies' increasing deployment of hybrid cloud solutions and data-intensive workloads. \nIn the comms service providers segment, we continue to gain share as customers choose to virtualize and transform their networks and prepare for the 5G transition using Intel Architecture. \nOur Programmable Solutions Group also delivered strong results this quarter. PSG again set a record for design win volumes, indicating customers' confidence in our road map and growing adoption of FPGAs for workload acceleration from the data center through the network and out to the edge. \nEarlier this month, we announced the planned acquisition of eASIC, which will give us a competitive differentiator and another solution to meet customers' diverse time-to-market performance, cost and power needs. \nWe combined Intel and Altera 2.5 years ago and we expected a key value driver to be the increasing use of FPGAs in the data center. In Q2, PSG's data center business more than doubled for the second consecutive quarter. \nIoTG set an all-time revenue record with particular strength in the retail and industrial sectors as customers look to Intel not only for compute performance, but for solutions that drive business value. We also completed the sale of Wind River as we continue to redeploy resources to higher growth and return areas. \nBuilding on this industry leadership in ADAS and driving the industry toward an autonomous future, Mobileye set another all-time revenue record. Customer momentum continued with several design wins, including a multimillion unit deal with ZF for a large global automaker. \nWe also announced that Baidu has adopted Mobileye's EyeQ base surround computer vision kit as the preferred vision solution for commercial Apollo pilot AV deployment. In both the open source and commercial Apollo programs, Baidu will also integrate Mobileye's responsibility sensitive safety model, an open and transparent model that provides safety assurance for AV decision-making, an industry imperative. \nOur memory business also set an all-time revenue record. We are transforming the memory industry with a pair of differentiated platform-connected capabilities, high-density Floating Gate 3D NAND and high-performance persistent Optane technology. \nWe've recently announced that we are in production on the industry's first 4 bits per cell data center NAND PCIe SSDs. And at the same time, industry support for Intel Optane DC persistent memory continues to grow with technology leaders, including CERN, Google, SAP and Tencent already announcing plans for future use of the technology. Unlike traditional DRAM, Intel Optane DC persistent memory will offer the unprecedented combination of high capacity, up to 3 terabytes per socket, along with affordability and persistence. \nIntel and Micron recently announced that we will develop future generations of 3D XPoint technology independently to better align the technology to our individual business needs and strategy. We'll continue to jointly manufacture 3D XPoint at the Intel Micron flash technology fab in Lehi. \nIntel intends to extend its leadership with Intel Optane products based on 3D XPoint, which, combined with our high-density 3D NAND technology, offer the best solution for today's computing and storage needs. \nAnd finally, in client computing, our focus on innovation and differentiation in the commercial, enthusiast and fin and light segments is producing results. Overall market conditions also continue to improve, and we now expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year for the first time since 2011. \nThe commercial segment remains strong as CIOs refreshing aging PC fleets are turning to Intel Core processors with vPro as the gold standard for performance and manageability. \nAt the same time, consumer interest in gaming and our outright performance leadership are driving strength in the enthusiast segment, producing another outstanding quarter in gaming. These trends reflect the market's demand for our highest performance products, resulting in strong overall product mix in CCG. \nWe also began shipping the 7560 modem, Intel's first CDMA and first multi-SIM capable modem. \nOur industry-leading products continue to deliver outstanding results. We have a leadership 14-nanometer product lineup for 2019 and we continue to make progress on 10-nanometer. Yields are improving consistent with the time line we shared in April and we expect systems on shelves for the 2019 holiday season. \nIn the second quarter, we announced the CEO change. The board is making good progress determining the best person to be the next CEO of this great company. While there is no timetable, the board is working with a sense of urgency and the identification of candidates, both internal and external, is well underway. \nPersonally, and on behalf of Intel's 100,000-plus employees, I'd like to thank Brian for his many contributions to the company over his 35-year career. The investments he made set us on a course for transformation. Even more importantly, he developed the right strategy and leadership team to carry that transformation forward while we conduct the CEO search. Our financial results in the second quarter show we're doing just that. Let's turn to the numbers. \nRevenue of $17 billion was up 15% year-over-year, marking a second record quarter. We saw strong performance across all of our businesses and record revenue in NSG, IoTG and Mobileye. Our data-centric businesses were collectively up 26%. Excellent operating margin leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in EPS of $1.04, up 44% year-on-year, even as we continue to invest for growth. \nFrom a capital allocation perspective, year-to-date we have generated $6.3 billion of free cash flow, returned $8.6 billion to shareholders, including $2.8 billion in dividends and $5.8 billion in buybacks, repurchasing 117 million shares. \nAs a result of the continued strength we are seeing in the business, we are raising our full year revenue guide by $2 billion to $69.5 billion. We are also raising our EPS guide by $0.30 versus April to $4.15, and the free cash flow guide by $0.5 billion to $15 billion. \nOur leadership products are winning in an expanded TAM and our data-centric businesses are now almost 50% of our total revenue. Our data-centric businesses had strong quarters, with each business individually growing at a double-digit rate. Our PC-centric business was up 6% on strength in the commercial and enthusiast segments. \nQ2 was another quarter of significant EPS growth, up 44% year-on-year. And our operating margin expanded $1.4 billion and 5 points year-on-year. Our EPS improvement was driven by growing demand for high-performance products in the data center and client businesses, leading to higher volumes and ASPs, strong growth in our adjacent businesses and lower tax rate and lower share count as a result of buybacks. \nIn January, we pulled in our 30% spending goal for 2018, a full 2 years ahead of schedule. We are on track to meet that target and our operating efficiency continues to improve. We remain extremely diligent in managing spending while prioritizing investments in areas that will accelerate revenue growth, product leadership, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. This focused approach is producing results. \nTotal Q2 spending came in at $5.1 billion, 30% of revenue. Total spending as a percentage of revenue is down 4.6 points year-over-year in the quarter while we continue to increase investment in our key priorities. Versus the second quarter of last year, we delivered $2.2 billion more revenue with no incremental spending. Let's talk now about our Q2 performance by segment. \nThe Data Center Group delivered another great double-digit growth quarter with revenue of $5.5 billion, up 27% year-over-year and operating income of $2.7 billion, up 65%.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Interim CEO, Executive VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Mark. This summer, we celebrated our 50th anniversary, and this quarter was the best quarter in our 50-year history. Record quarterly revenue of $19.2 billion was up 19%. Our operating margins expanded 5 points, and earnings per share of $1.40 was up 39%. Our results were driven by incredibly strong demand and customer preference for the performance of our leadership products across the business. Our data center, client computing, Internet of Things, memory and Mobileye businesses all achieved record revenue. We expect 2018 to be the best year ever and our third record year in a row. 
Before we get deeper into the financials, I'll take a few minutes to talk about our strategy, our products and our people. First, our strategy. We are growing share in a larger TAM, driving operating leverage while increasing our R&D investments and delivering attractive capital returns. Our thesis is that the massive growth of data worldwide will increase demand for the analysis, storage and sharing of data. We are one of the few companies that touches every part of the data revolution. And we've invested both organically and acquisitively to capitalize on these trends to accelerate the growth of the company while at the same time, delivering significant operating leverage and exiting noncore businesses. Our disciplined focus is delivering outstanding results. Demand in growth this year continue to exceed our expectations. Collectively, our data-centric businesses are up 22% year-to-date, led by growth in the cloud and communication service provider segments. 
In both our data centric and PC businesses, our CPU leadership puts us in a great position to capitalize on this massive data opportunity by delivering more value to a broader set of customers. We've expanded beyond CPUs with memory, modems, FPGAs and silicon for emerging high-growth workloads like ADAS, artificial intelligence and 5G communications. We acquired Mobileye, which has integrated Intel Architecture to produce the industry's leading ADAS and autonomous driving platforms. Mobileye also just announced the ability to fully retrofit existing vehicles to deliver full autonomy, moving Mobileye further up the value chain. The acquisitions of Altera and Movidius are enabling us to partner with customers to expand the markets that they serve. They're developing new AI capabilities by combining our Core products with our FPGAs and VPUs. This is most evident in computer vision applications, which cut across all of our IoT verticals.
As a result, our opportunity has never been bigger. We are competing and winning share in a $300 billion TAM, transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company in the process. We now expect full year revenue to grow more than $8.4 billion over 2017. And in the first 9 months of the year, we have returned $12.6 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends or 112% of free cash flow. 
We've also achieved outstanding growth in our PC-centric business. After 7 years of decline, we expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year, and we continue to gain share in modems. We've focused our investments in the PC sector and the areas where we see growth and where our performance leadership and differentiation matters most, the commercial, gaming and 2-in-1 segments. 
Second, our products. Our strategy is delivering results because we have products that are solving our customers' problems. We're making the products we have even better and expanding our portfolio to deliver more value to customers. One of the most important things we do is collaborate with our customers and ecosystem partners to deliver exciting new computing experiences. We do that broadly with our OEMs. An example in our PC business was the launch of the stunning, new HP Spectre Folio, a 2-in-1 we worked closely with HP to develop. We leveraged our expertise in thermal tuning and motherboard miniaturization while achieving up to 19 hours battery life through power tuning and the use of Intel's low-power display technology. This sort of innovation is impossible without Intel's exceptionally broad range of IP and the scale and expertise to partner deeply with our customers on design. We also launched the new 9th Gen Intel Core desktop processors, including the world's best gaming processor.
In our data-centric businesses, we announced 95 new performance world records for Xeon Scalable and continue to see strong adoption while we work with customers to get ready for the transition to Cascade Lake. Cascade Lake introduces hardware-based side channel mitigation, Intel DL Boost with 11x inference speed-up and a revolutionary new technology, Optane DC persistent memory. And we're deepening our engagement with customers on custom SKUs. In fact, we'll have 60% more custom SKUs in the Cascade Lake family than the prior generation. 
We shipped our first revenue units of Optane DC persistent memory to Google, Microsoft and Alibaba, and we're already receiving great feedback. Microsoft reported a new performance record of 13.7 million IOPs using Xeon Scalable and Optane, a level they said they've never seen with any other platform approach. Customers also continue to choose Intel as a partner as they use artificial intelligence to transform their businesses. Taboola chose Intel Xeon over GPUs for a massive inference speed-up and scale out across 7 data centers, delivering 360 billion content recommendations monthly. Rolls-Royce will design autonomous ships running inference on Xeon and are evaluating more of our portfolio in a multiyear engagement.
Mobileye customer momentum continued with 8 new design wins at major U.S. and global automakers, bringing our 2018 design win total to 20. Mobileye also shipped 3.3 million EyeQ SoCs in the third quarter, bringing lifetime total to more than 33 million units.
While our current product lineup is compelling, our road map is even more exciting. We continue to make good progress on 10-nanometer. Yields are improving, and we're on track for 10-nanometer-based systems on shelves during the holiday 2019 selling season. The breadth of IP we've assembled, combined with Intel's design, software, packaging and manufacturing capability, gives us an unmatched ability to invent the industry's future. 
Third, and most importantly, our people. Intel has amazing talent, including world-class scientists and engineers, and we are making excellent progress toward our commitment to a fully representative workforce. Intel employees are at their best when they're working together to address challenges. And faced with explosive and unexpected demand this year, they've exhibited incredible problem-solving skills to deliver this quarter's results. The PC TAM has returned to growth, and our data center business is growing at more than twice the rate we expected in January. Our full year revenue outlook is now more than $6 billion higher than our January forecast. And we have supply to support this revised guidance, thanks to outstanding responsiveness from our factory teams. 
We are focused on doing everything possible not to constrain our customers' growth. We've increased our CapEx by $1.5 billion since January to a record $15.5 billion. We've repositioned some 10-nanometer capacity to 14-nanometer, and we're making progress with our 10-nanometer process technology. 
Supply is tightest at the entry-level of the PC market and in our IoTG business. Within our CPU product lines, we're prioritizing the production of our Xeon and Core processors so that we and our customers can serve the high performance segments in the market. Our biggest challenge in Q4 will be meeting any additional PC and IoTG demand beyond our guidance, and we do expect fourth quarter upside from here will be limited.
Summing it up, our strategy, leadership products and amazing people combined to produce the best quarter in the company's history. We're well on track to another record year. 
With that, let's turn to the details. Third quarter revenue of $19.2 billion was up 19% year-over-year. Our data-centric businesses were collectively up 22%, and our PC-centric business was up 16%. Outstanding business performance, continued operating leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in non-GAAP net income of $6.5 billion, up 34% year-over-year. EPS of $1.40 was up 39% year-over-year.
Year-to-date, we have generated $11.2 billion of free cash flow and returned $12.6 billion to shareholders, including $4.2 billion in dividends and $8.5 billion in buybacks, repurchasing 167 million shares. We continue to see strong momentum in our business and are raising our full year revenue guide by $1.7 billion to $71.2 billion. We are also raising our EPS guide by $0.38 versus July to $4.53 and our free cash flow guide by $500 million to $15.5 billion. Our revenue guidance for 2018 is up greater than $6 billion versus our January expectations as we focus on a strong finish to a record year.
Our leadership products continue to win share in our expanded TAM as both our data-centric and PC-centric businesses grew at double-digit rates this quarter. Our data-centric businesses were up 22% as customers choose our performance products to move, store and process more data faster from the cloud to the edge. And our PC-centric business was up 16% as we saw continued strength in the commercial and gaming PC segments and grew modem share. 
Operating income increased by more than $2 billion with margin up 5.1 points year-over-year in the third quarter, marking our highest operating margin percentage since 2011. EPS climbed to $1.40, up 39% year-on-year. Our EPS improvement was driven by growing demand for high-performance products in the data center and client businesses leading to higher volumes and ASPs, continued growth in our adjacent businesses, a lower tax rate and lower share count as a result of buybacks. 
Our focus on operational efficiency continues to produce strong results. We now expect full year spending as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 29%, down about 7 points since 2015 while R&D is up $1.4 billion over the same period. We continue to improve our leverage while increasing investment in our key priorities such as product leadership, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. Disciplined spending with a focus on prioritizing the most important investment opportunities is a key lever in magnifying our revenue opportunities and it's apparent in our results. Over the last 3 years, we've grown annual revenue by nearly $16 billion while adding less t

Swan,  Intel Corporation - Interim CEO, Executive VP & CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thanks, Mark. This summer, we celebrated our 50th anniversary, and this quarter was the best quarter in our 50-year history. Record quarterly revenue of $19.2 billion was up 19%. Our operating margins expanded 5 points, and earnings per share of $1.40 was up 39%. Our results were driven by incredibly strong demand and customer preference for the performance of our leadership products across the business. Our data center, client computing, Internet of Things, memory and Mobileye businesses all achieved record revenue. We expect 2018 to be the best year ever and our third record year in a row. \nBefore we get deeper into the financials, I'll take a few minutes to talk about our strategy, our products and our people. First, our strategy. We are growing share in a larger TAM, driving operating leverage while increasing our R&D investments and delivering attractive capital returns. Our thesis is that the massive growth of data worldwide will increase demand for the analysis, storage and sharing of data. We are one of the few companies that touches every part of the data revolution. And we've invested both organically and acquisitively to capitalize on these trends to accelerate the growth of the company while at the same time, delivering significant operating leverage and exiting noncore businesses. Our disciplined focus is delivering outstanding results. Demand in growth this year continue to exceed our expectations. Collectively, our data-centric businesses are up 22% year-to-date, led by growth in the cloud and communication service provider segments. \nIn both our data centric and PC businesses, our CPU leadership puts us in a great position to capitalize on this massive data opportunity by delivering more value to a broader set of customers. We've expanded beyond CPUs with memory, modems, FPGAs and silicon for emerging high-growth workloads like ADAS, artificial intelligence and 5G communications. We acquired Mobileye, which has integrated Intel Architecture to produce the industry's leading ADAS and autonomous driving platforms. Mobileye also just announced the ability to fully retrofit existing vehicles to deliver full autonomy, moving Mobileye further up the value chain. The acquisitions of Altera and Movidius are enabling us to partner with customers to expand the markets that they serve. They're developing new AI capabilities by combining our Core products with our FPGAs and VPUs. This is most evident in computer vision applications, which cut across all of our IoT verticals.\nAs a result, our opportunity has never been bigger. We are competing and winning share in a $300 billion TAM, transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company in the process. We now expect full year revenue to grow more than $8.4 billion over 2017. And in the first 9 months of the year, we have returned $12.6 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends or 112% of free cash flow. \nWe've also achieved outstanding growth in our PC-centric business. After 7 years of decline, we expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year, and we continue to gain share in modems. We've focused our investments in the PC sector and the areas where we see growth and where our performance leadership and differentiation matters most, the commercial, gaming and 2-in-1 segments. \nSecond, our products. Our strategy is delivering results because we have products that are solving our customers' problems. We're making the products we have even better and expanding our portfolio to deliver more value to customers. One of the most important things we do is collaborate with our customers and ecosystem partners to deliver exciting new computing experiences. We do that broadly with our OEMs. An example in our PC business was the launch of the stunning, new HP Spectre Folio, a 2-in-1 we worked closely with HP to develop. We leveraged our expertise in thermal tuning and motherboard miniaturization while achieving up to 19 hours battery life through power tuning and the use of Intel's low-power display technology. This sort of innovation is impossible without Intel's exceptionally broad range of IP and the scale and expertise to partner deeply with our customers on design. We also launched the new 9th Gen Intel Core desktop processors, including the world's best gaming processor.\nIn our data-centric businesses, we announced 95 new performance world records for Xeon Scalable and continue to see strong adoption while we work with customers to get ready for the transition to Cascade Lake. Cascade Lake introduces hardware-based side channel mitigation, Intel DL Boost with 11x inference speed-up and a revolutionary new technology, Optane DC persistent memory. And we're deepening our engagement with customers on custom SKUs. In fact, we'll have 60% more custom SKUs in the Cascade Lake family than the prior generation. \nWe shipped our first revenue units of Optane DC persistent memory to Google, Microsoft and Alibaba, and we're already receiving great feedback. Microsoft reported a new performance record of 13.7 million IOPs using Xeon Scalable and Optane, a level they said they've never seen with any other platform approach. Customers also continue to choose Intel as a partner as they use artificial intelligence to transform their businesses. Taboola chose Intel Xeon over GPUs for a massive inference speed-up and scale out across 7 data centers, delivering 360 billion content recommendations monthly. Rolls-Royce will design autonomous ships running inference on Xeon and are evaluating more of our portfolio in a multiyear engagement.\nMobileye customer momentum continued with 8 new design wins at major U.S. and global automakers, bringing our 2018 design win total to 20. Mobileye also shipped 3.3 million EyeQ SoCs in the third quarter, bringing lifetime total to more than 33 million units.\nWhile our current product lineup is compelling, our road map is even more exciting. We continue to make good progress on 10-nanometer. Yields are improving, and we're on track for 10-nanometer-based systems on shelves during the holiday 2019 selling season. The breadth of IP we've assembled, combined with Intel's design, software, packaging and manufacturing capability, gives us an unmatched ability to invent the industry's future. \nThird, and most importantly, our people. Intel has amazing talent, including world-class scientists and engineers, and we are making excellent progress toward our commitment to a fully representative workforce. Intel employees are at their best when they're working together to address challenges. And faced with explosive and unexpected demand this year, they've exhibited incredible problem-solving skills to deliver this quarter's results. The PC TAM has returned to growth, and our data center business is growing at more than twice the rate we expected in January. Our full year revenue outlook is now more than $6 billion higher than our January forecast. And we have supply to support this revised guidance, thanks to outstanding responsiveness from our factory teams. \nWe are focused on doing everything possible not to constrain our customers' growth. We've increased our CapEx by $1.5 billion since January to a record $15.5 billion. We've repositioned some 10-nanometer capacity to 14-nanometer, and we're making progress with our 10-nanometer process technology. \nSupply is tightest at the entry-level of the PC market and in our IoTG business. Within our CPU product lines, we're prioritizing the production of our Xeon and Core processors so that we and our customers can serve the high performance segments in the market. Our biggest challenge in Q4 will be meeting any additional PC and IoTG demand beyond our guidance, and we do expect fourth quarter upside from here will be limited.\nSumming it up, our strategy, leadership products and amazing people combined to produce the best quarter in the company's history. We're well on track to another record year. \nWith that, let's turn to the details. Third quarter revenue of $19.2 billion was up 19% year-over-year. Our data-centric businesses were collectively up 22%, and our PC-centric business was up 16%. Outstanding business performance, continued operating leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in non-GAAP net income of $6.5 billion, up 34% year-over-year. EPS of $1.40 was up 39% year-over-year.\nYear-to-date, we have generated $11.2 billion of free cash flow and returned $12.6 billion to shareholders, including $4.2 billion in dividends and $8.5 billion in buybacks, repurchasing 167 million shares. We continue to see strong momentum in our business and are raising our full year revenue guide by $1.7 billion to $71.2 billion. We are also raising our EPS guide by $0.38 versus July to $4.53 and our free cash flow guide by $500 million to $15.5 billion. Our revenue guidance for 2018 is up greater than $6 billion versus our January expectations as we focus on a strong finish to a record year.\nOur leadership products continue to win share in our expanded TAM as both our data-centric and PC-centric businesses grew at double-digit rates this quarter. Our data-centric businesses were up 22% as customers choose our performance products to move, store and process more data faster from the cloud to the edge. And our PC-centric business was up 16% as we saw continued strength in the commercial and gaming PC segments and grew modem share. \nOperating income increased by more than $2 billion with margin up 5.1 points year-over-year in the third quarter, marking our highest operating margin percentage since 2011.

          Thanks, Mark. This summer, we celebrated our 50th anniversary, and this quarter was the best quarter in our 50-year history. Record quarterly revenue of $19.2 billion was up 19%. Our operating margins expanded 5 points, and earnings per share of $1.40 was up 39%.

Outstanding business performance, continued operating leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in non-GAAP net income of $6.5 billion, up 34% year-over-year. EPS of $1.40 was up 39% year-over-year.
Year-to-date, we have generated $11.2 billion of free cash flow and returned $12.6 billion to shareholders, including $4.2 billion in dividends and $8.5 billion in buybacks, repurchasing 167 million shares.

We are also raising our EPS guide by $0.38 versus July to $4.53 and our free cash flow guide by $500 million to $15.5 billion. Our revenue guidance for 2018 is up greater than $6 billion versus our January expectations as we focus on a strong finish to a record year.
Our leadership products continue to win share in our expanded TAM as both our data-centric and PC-centric businesses grew at double-digit rates this quarter. Our data-centric businesses were up 22% as customers choose our performance products to move, store and process more data faster from the cloud to the edge. And our PC-centric business was up 16% as we saw continued strength in the commercial and gaming PC segments and grew modem share. 
Operating income increased by more than $2 billion with margin up 5.1 points year-over-year in the third quarter, marking our highest operating margin percentage since 2011.

Our EPS improvement was driven by growing demand for high-performance products in the data center and client businesses leading to higher volumes and ASPs, continued growth in our adjacent businesses, a lower tax rate and lower share count as a result of buybacks. 
Our focus on operational efficiency continues to produce strong results. We now expect full year spending as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 29%, down about 7 points since 2015 while R&D is up $1.4 billion over the same period. We continue to improve our leverage while increasing investment in our key priorities such as product leadership, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. Disciplined spending with a focus on prioritizing the most important investment opportunities is a key lever in magnifying our revenue opportunities and it's apparent in our results. Over the last 3 years, we've grown annual revenue by nearly $16 billion while adding less t

Swan,  Intel Corporation - Interim CEO, Executive VP & CFO    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thanks, Mark. This summer, we celebrated our 50th anniversary, and this quarter was the best quarter in our 50-year history. Record quarterly revenue of $19.2 billion was up 19%. Our operating margins expanded 5 points, and earnings per share of $1.40 was up 39%. Our results were driven by incredibly strong demand and customer preference for the performance of our leadership products across the business. Our data center, client computing, Internet of Things, memory and Mobileye businesses all achieved record revenue. We expect 2018 to be the best year ever and our third record year in a row. \nBefore we get deeper into the financials, I'll take a few minutes to talk about our strategy, our products and our people. First, our strategy. We are growing share in a larger TAM, driving operating leverage while increasing our R&D investments and delivering attractive capital returns. Our thesis is that the massive growth of data worldwide will increase demand for the analysis, storage and sharing of data. We are one of the few companies that touches every part of the data revolution. And we've invested both organically and acquisitively to capitalize on these trends to accelerate the growth of the company while at the same time, delivering significant operating leverage and exiting noncore businesses. Our disciplined focus is delivering outstanding results. Demand in growth this year continue to exceed our expectations. Collectively, our data-centric businesses are up 22% year-to-date, led by growth in the cloud and communication service provider segments. \nIn both our data centric and PC businesses, our CPU leadership puts us in a great position to capitalize on this massive data opportunity by delivering more value to a broader set of customers. We've expanded beyond CPUs with memory, modems, FPGAs and silicon for emerging high-growth workloads like ADAS, artificial intelligence and 5G communications. We acquired Mobileye, which has integrated Intel Architecture to produce the industry's leading ADAS and autonomous driving platforms. Mobileye also just announced the ability to fully retrofit existing vehicles to deliver full autonomy, moving Mobileye further up the value chain. The acquisitions of Altera and Movidius are enabling us to partner with customers to expand the markets that they serve. They're developing new AI capabilities by combining our Core products with our FPGAs and VPUs. This is most evident in computer vision applications, which cut across all of our IoT verticals.\nAs a result, our opportunity has never been bigger. We are competing and winning share in a $300 billion TAM, transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company in the process. We now expect full year revenue to grow more than $8.4 billion over 2017. And in the first 9 months of the year, we have returned $12.6 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends or 112% of free cash flow. \nWe've also achieved outstanding growth in our PC-centric business. After 7 years of decline, we expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year, and we continue to gain share in modems. We've focused our investments in the PC sector and the areas where we see growth and where our performance leadership and differentiation matters most, the commercial, gaming and 2-in-1 segments. \nSecond, our products. Our strategy is delivering results because we have products that are solving our customers' problems. We're making the products we have even better and expanding our portfolio to deliver more value to customers. One of the most important things we do is collaborate with our customers and ecosystem partners to deliver exciting new computing experiences. We do that broadly with our OEMs. An example in our PC business was the launch of the stunning, new HP Spectre Folio, a 2-in-1 we worked closely with HP to develop. We leveraged our expertise in thermal tuning and motherboard miniaturization while achieving up to 19 hours battery life through power tuning and the use of Intel's low-power display technology. This sort of innovation is impossible without Intel's exceptionally broad range of IP and the scale and expertise to partner deeply with our customers on design. We also launched the new 9th Gen Intel Core desktop processors, including the world's best gaming processor.\nIn our data-centric businesses, we announced 95 new performance world records for Xeon Scalable and continue to see strong adoption while we work with customers to get ready for the transition to Cascade Lake. Cascade Lake introduces hardware-based side channel mitigation, Intel DL Boost with 11x inference speed-up and a revolutionary new technology, Optane DC persistent memory. And we're deepening our engagement with customers on custom SKUs. In fact, we'll have 60% more custom SKUs in the Cascade Lake family than the prior generation. \nWe shipped our first revenue units of Optane DC persistent memory to Google, Microsoft and Alibaba, and we're already receiving great feedback. Microsoft reported a new performance record of 13.7 million IOPs using Xeon Scalable and Optane, a level they said they've never seen with any other platform approach. Customers also continue to choose Intel as a partner as they use artificial intelligence to transform their businesses. Taboola chose Intel Xeon over GPUs for a massive inference speed-up and scale out across 7 data centers, delivering 360 billion content recommendations monthly. Rolls-Royce will design autonomous ships running inference on Xeon and are evaluating more of our portfolio in a multiyear engagement.\nMobileye customer momentum continued with 8 new design wins at major U.S. and global automakers, bringing our 2018 design win total to 20. Mobileye also shipped 3.3 million EyeQ SoCs in the third quarter, bringing lifetime total to more than 33 million units.\nWhile our current product lineup is compelling, our road map is even more exciting. We continue to make good progress on 10-nanometer. Yields are improving, and we're on track for 10-nanometer-based systems on shelves during the holiday 2019 selling season. The breadth of IP we've assembled, combined with Intel's design, software, packaging and manufacturing capability, gives us an unmatched ability to invent the industry's future. \nThird, and most importantly, our people. Intel has amazing talent, including world-class scientists and engineers, and we are making excellent progress toward our commitment to a fully representative workforce. Intel employees are at their best when they're working together to address challenges. And faced with explosive and unexpected demand this year, they've exhibited incredible problem-solving skills to deliver this quarter's results. The PC TAM has returned to growth, and our data center business is growing at more than twice the rate we expected in January. Our full year revenue outlook is now more than $6 billion higher than our January forecast. And we have supply to support this revised guidance, thanks to outstanding responsiveness from our factory teams. \nWe are focused on doing everything possible not to constrain our customers' growth. We've increased our CapEx by $1.5 billion since January to a record $15.5 billion. We've repositioned some 10-nanometer capacity to 14-nanometer, and we're making progress with our 10-nanometer process technology. \nSupply is tightest at the entry-level of the PC market and in our IoTG business. Within our CPU product lines, we're prioritizing the production of our Xeon and Core processors so that we and our customers can serve the high performance segments in the market. Our biggest challenge in Q4 will be meeting any additional PC and IoTG demand beyond our guidance, and we do expect fourth quarter upside from here will be limited.\nSumming it up, our strategy, leadership products and amazing people combined to produce the best quarter in the company's history. We're well on track to another record year. \nWith that, let's turn to the details. Third quarter revenue of $19.2 billion was up 19% year-over-year. Our data-centric businesses were collectively up 22%, and our PC-centric business was up 16%. Outstanding business performance, continued operating leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in non-GAAP net income of $6.5 billion, up 34% year-over-year. EPS of $1.40 was up 39% year-over-year.\nYear-to-date, we have generated $11.2 billion of free cash flow and returned $12.6 billion to shareholders, including $4.2 billion in dividends and $8.5 billion in buybacks, repurchasing 167 million shares. We continue to see strong momentum in our business and are raising our full year revenue guide by $1.7 billion to $71.2 billion. We are also raising our EPS guide by $0.38 versus July to $4.53 and our free cash flow guide by $500 million to $15.5 billion. Our revenue guidance for 2018 is up greater than $6 billion versus our January expectations as we focus on a strong finish to a record year.\nOur leadership products continue to win share in our expanded TAM as both our data-centric and PC-centric businesses grew at double-digit rates this quarter. Our data-centric businesses were up 22% as customers choose our performance products to move, store and process more data faster from the cloud to the edge. And our PC-centric business was up 16% as we saw continued strength in the commercial and gaming PC segments and grew modem share. \nOperating income increased by more than $2 billion with margin up 5.1 points year-over-year in the third quarter, marking our highest operating margin percentage since 2011. EPS climbed to $1.40, up 39% year-on-year. Our EPS improvement was driven by growing demand for high-performance products in the data center and client businesses leading to higher volumes and ASPs, continued growth in our adjacent businesses, a lower tax rate and lower share count as a result of buybacks. \nOur focus on operational efficiency continues to produce strong results. We now expect full year spending as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 29%, down about 7 points since 2015 while R&D is up $1.4 billion over the same period. We continue to improve our leverage while increasing investment in our key priorities such as product leadership, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving.

This growth was driven by strong demand and customer preference for Intel's leadership products across various business segments, including data center, client computing, Internet of Things (IoT), memory, and Mobileye. The company expects 2018 to be its third consecutive record year.

Intel's strategy focuses on growing its share in a larger Total Addressable Market (TAM), driving operating leverage, increasing R&D investments, and delivering attractive capital returns. The company believes that the massive growth in data worldwide will lead to increased demand for data analysis, storage, and sharing. Intel has invested both organically and through acquisitions to capitalize on these trends and accelerate the company's growth.

Intel's data-centric businesses have outperformed expectations, with 22% year-to-date growth, driven by growth in the cloud and communication service provider segments. The company's CPU leadership in both the data-centric and PC businesses positions it well to capitalize on the growing data opportunity. Intel has expanded beyond CPUs with offerings such as memory, modems, FPGAs, and silicon for emerging high-growth workloads like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 5G communications. Strategic acquisitions, such as Mobileye, Altera, and Movidius, have enabled Intel to partner with customers and expand into new markets.

In the PC-centric business, Intel has seen outstanding growth after 7 years of decline. The company expects modest growth in the PC TAM this year and continues to gain share in modems. Intel has focused its investments in the commercial, gaming, and 2-in-1 segments where it has performance leadership and differentiation.

Intel's product portfolio is delivering results, with collaboration with customers and ecosystem partners to deliver new computing experiences. In the PC business, Intel collaborated closely with HP to launch the HP Spectre Folio, a 2-in-1 device that leverages Intel's expertise in thermal tuning and motherboard miniaturization. In the data-centric businesses, Intel announced 95 new performance world records for its Xeon Scalable processors and shipped its first revenue units of Optane DC persistent memory to major customers like Google, Microsoft, and Alibaba. Intel's future road map includes progress on its 10-nanometer technology, with systems based on this technology expected to be available in the market during the 2019 holiday season.

Intel's outstanding performance in the third quarter is attributed to strong business momentum, continued operating leverage, and a lower tax rate. The company's non-GAAP net income increased by 34% year-over-year to $6.5 billion, with EPS up 39% to $1.40. Intel has generated $11.2 billion of free cash flow year-to-date and returned $12.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, including repurchasing 167 million shares. The company expects full-year revenue to reach $71.2 billion, an increase of $6 billion from its January expectations. Intel's full-year EPS guidance has been raised to $4.53, and free cash flow guidance has been increased to $15.5 billion.

Despite the strong performance, Intel faces challenges in meeting additional demand in the fourth quarter, particularly in the entry-level PC market and IoT business. The company has increased its CapEx by $1.5 billion to support this demand. Intel remains focused on operational efficiency and disciplined spending while prioritizing key investment opportunities. The company expects a strong finish to the year and is well-positioned for another record year.",gpt-3

Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Mark. 2017 was a record year for Intel, and fourth quarter results were outstanding, well ahead of the forecast we outlined in October, based on the strength of both our PC-centric and data-centric businesses. I'll review our results with you in just a moment, but before I do that, I'd like to share a few words about security. 
We've been working around the clock with our customers and partners to address the security vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown. While we've made progress, I am acutely aware that we have more to do. We've committed to being transparent, keeping our customers and owners appraised (sic) [apprised] of our progress and, through our actions, building trust. Security is a top priority for Intel, foundational to our products, and it's critical to the success of our data-centric strategy. Our near-term focus is on delivering high-quality mitigations to protect our customers' infrastructure on these exploits. We're working to incorporate silicon-based changes to future products that will directly address the Spectre and Meltdown threats in hardware, and those products will begin appearing later this year. However, these circumstances are highly dynamic, and we updated our risk factors to reflect both the evolving nature of these specific threats and mitigations as well as the security challenge more broadly. 
Security has always been a priority for us, and these events reinforce our continuous mission to develop the world's most secure products. This will be an ongoing journey, but we are committed to that task, and I'm confident we are up to the challenge. To keep you informed, we've created a dedicated website and we're approaching this work with customer-first urgency. I've assigned some of the very best minds at Intel to work through this, and we're making progress. 
With that, let's turn to our 2017 and fourth quarter results. We just wrapped up the best year in Intel's history with the best quarter in Intel's history. Revenue was up 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, 8% if you exclude McAfee, setting an all-time record. Our data center, IoT and FPGA businesses each set revenue records. We met or exceeded all of the financial commitments we made to you at the beginning of the year, and our focus on efficiency and profitable growth produced significant leverage, driving non-GAAP operating income up 21%. 
Our data-centric businesses delivered the technology foundations for the new data economy, making the analysis, storage and transfer of data possible, giving our customers the ability to turn data into amazing experiences and actionable insights. They're essential to our strategy. Data-centric revenue, excluding McAfee, was up an impressive 21% over the fourth quarter of last year, and I'd like to share a few highlights with you starting with DCG. 
DCG's revenue was up 20% over the fourth quarter. The cloud segment was up 35%, comm service providers were up 16%, enterprise was up 11%, and our adjacency revenue was up 35%. We saw broad-based demand strength with customer preference for high-performance products driving richer ASP mix. Cloud segment results were driven by significant volume growth and continued customer preference for higher-performance products. In the comms service provider segment, we continued to take share and grow revenue as customers chose IA-based solutions to virtualize and transform their networks. Enterprise segment strength was driven mostly by ASP as customers transitioned to Xeon Scalable products in a seasonally strong fourth quarter IT buying window. 
While we continue to see enterprise customers offload workloads to the public cloud, we are also seeing those customers prioritize performance solutions for hybrid and on-premise buildouts. Customers across all of our segments are accelerating deployment on Xeon Scalable processors, which is ramping roughly in line with our historical Xeon transition. 
We continue to demonstrate leadership and progress in artificial intelligence with the data center, the edge and some hundreds of watts to milliwatts. Our software optimizations for the Caffe framework has improved already strong, beyond scalable ResNet-50 inference performance by 2x just since the launch in July. The first-generation Nervana neural network processor ran a neural network less than 2 weeks after we received silicon, and we've shipped our first customer units.
At the edge, Google announced its AIY Vision Kit featuring our Movidius vision processing unit, and Amazon announced DeepLens, the world's first deep learning-enabled video camera for developers, which uses an Intel CPU, graphics and compute libraries for deep neural networks. 
We're also seeing design wins that combine technologies from multiple data-centric business units, reinforcing the idea that we have developed a unique and differentiated collection of capabilities that can address customer challenges together more effectively than any one business could alone. 
A great example is Dahua's recent announcement of their Deep Sense product line, which combines Core CPU, Intel FPGA-based network video recorders, along with Movidius VPU-based cameras, to enable people and automobile detection and smart city application using artificial intelligence. 
In the Programmable Solutions Group, we saw strong double-digit growth in the data center, auto, embedded and advanced products categories as well as last-time buys of legacy products. That strength was partially offset by softness in comms infrastructure. In Q4, we launched the Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL that dramatically increased productivity for our customers. We also delivered first-to-market leadership innovations in the Stratix 10 product line, including the first SoC FPGA with an ARM processor at more than 1 million logic elements and the industry's first FPGA with integrated HBM2 memory. 
Our Internet of Things Group grew 21% with continuing momentum in retail, video and in-vehicle infotainment verticals. Wind River saw strong multiyear contractor growth and delivered its profitable quarter ever for Intel. The memory business grew 9% and achieved profitability in Q4 as strong client volume was partially offset by a 1-quarter qualification delay of a data center's SSD volumes. 
Last quarter, I shared with you that our leadership technology is resulting in strong customer interest in long-term supply arrangements. That interest has continued to grow. We have since signed additional agreements and now expect prepayments totaling roughly $2 billion over the course of 2018. 
Mobileye had another strong quarter, and business momentum is growing. Our 30 design wins over the course of 2017 and 15 new program launches in 2018 are both increases of 2.5x over the prior period. We now have Level 2-plus and Level 3 design wins with 11 automakers who collectively represent more than 50% of global vehicle production. These advanced programs launch over the next 2 years, and they represent a major leap in functionality versus current semiautonomous system and are a significant step towards a scalable Level 4 and Level 5 fully autonomous system.
We reached an important milestone in the fourth quarter: the announcement of our Level 3 through 5 autonomous driving platform based on EyeQ5 and Atom, which we'll sample over the next few months. We believe this will be the most advanced, scalable and efficient platform of its kind. EyeQ5 will deliver 24 tera ops of deep learning performance in a 10-watt power envelope, or about 2.5x the efficiency of the competition. Just a couple of weeks ago at CES, we announced that, by the end of 2018, we expect 2 million EyeQ-equipped cars will be collecting crowdsourced data for REM, our Road Experience Management mapping solution. The resulting map will first be utilized in Level 3 beginning in 2019. The ability to crowdsource data to build and rapidly update the precision maps required for higher levels of automation is a major differentiator in our plan to build out the safest and most affordable autonomous vehicle system. It's also a great example of our data-centric strategy at work.
And finally, I'd like to touch on our PC-centric businesses, the Client Computing Group. Over the course of the year, the PC market improved. Our 14-nanometer manufacturing costs came down and the competitive environment intensified. Against that backdrop, PCG's focus on innovation and performance, especially in growth segments like gaming, 2-in-1s, thin and light notebooks and enterprise, led to a record Core mix and record i7 volume in the fourth quarter. We also shipped our first low-volume 10-nanometer SKU, and our modem business grew 26% over the fourth quarter of last year.
Intel is undergoing one of the most significant transformations in corporate history from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. We have made thoughtful, disciplined investments along the way that have expanded our TAM to $260 billion. Those same investments have produced a collection of data-centric businesses that are unmatched, growing at double-digit rates and approaching 50% of the company's revenue. Our opportunity is larger than it's ever been, and we're hungry to compete and win. 
In 2018, our highest priorities will be executing to our strategy and meeting the commitments we make to our owners and our customers. This includes our commitment to restoring customer confidence in the security of their data. 
This year, Intel will celebrate 0.5 centuries of innovation that has profoundly changed the world. Over the last 50 years, we invented the architecture and manufacturing technologies that have made personal computing, the Internet and the cloud not only possible, but pervasive. The journey hasn't been without challenges. Nothing worth doing ever is. Our culture has been forged through taking challenges head-on and developing solutions our customers can count on. That includes working directly to address the Spectre and Meltdown security threats. 
We leave 2017 on a financial high note, but I'm even more excited about what's to come, about our strategy producing great products for our customers and great returns for our owners. I see Intel innovation changing the world for another 50 years, and that journey starts with 2018. Over the coming year, we'll bring amazing innovation and performance to the PC market, advance the state of art in the artificial intelligence, lead the way towards mass 5G deployment, launch the industry's first new memory architecture in 2 decades and take another step toward a safer world in which autonomous driving is a reality. 
Looking back on 2017, I could not be more proud of our team and all they have accomplished. As I look to our 50th year, I'm more optimistic and confident than I've ever been about Intel's future. 
And with that, let me hand it over to Bob.

Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. CFO commentary and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. \nWith that, let me hand it over to Brian.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thanks, Mark. 2017 was a record year for Intel, and fourth quarter results were outstanding, well ahead of the forecast we outlined in October, based on the strength of both our PC-centric and data-centric businesses. I'll review our results with you in just a moment, but before I do that, I'd like to share a few words about security. \nWe've been working around the clock with our customers and partners to address the security vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown. While we've made progress, I am acutely aware that we have more to do. We've committed to being transparent, keeping our customers and owners appraised (sic) [apprised] of our progress and, through our actions, building trust. Security is a top priority for Intel, foundational to our products, and it's critical to the success of our data-centric strategy. Our near-term focus is on delivering high-quality mitigations to protect our customers' infrastructure on these exploits. We're working to incorporate silicon-based changes to future products that will directly address the Spectre and Meltdown threats in hardware, and those products will begin appearing later this year. However, these circumstances are highly dynamic, and we updated our risk factors to reflect both the evolving nature of these specific threats and mitigations as well as the security challenge more broadly. \nSecurity has always been a priority for us, and these events reinforce our continuous mission to develop the world's most secure products. This will be an ongoing journey, but we are committed to that task, and I'm confident we are up to the challenge. To keep you informed, we've created a dedicated website and we're approaching this work with customer-first urgency. I've assigned some of the very best minds at Intel to work through this, and we're making progress. \nWith that, let's turn to our 2017 and fourth quarter results. We just wrapped up the best year in Intel's history with the best quarter in Intel's history. Revenue was up 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, 8% if you exclude McAfee, setting an all-time record. Our data center, IoT and FPGA businesses each set revenue records. We met or exceeded all of the financial commitments we made to you at the beginning of the year, and our focus on efficiency and profitable growth produced significant leverage, driving non-GAAP operating income up 21%. \nOur data-centric businesses delivered the technology foundations for the new data economy, making the analysis, storage and transfer of data possible, giving our customers the ability to turn data into amazing experiences and actionable insights. They're essential to our strategy. Data-centric revenue, excluding McAfee, was up an impressive 21% over the fourth quarter of last year, and I'd like to share a few highlights with you starting with DCG. \nDCG's revenue was up 20% over the fourth quarter. The cloud segment was up 35%, comm service providers were up 16%, enterprise was up 11%, and our adjacency revenue was up 35%. We saw broad-based demand strength with customer preference for high-performance products driving richer ASP mix. Cloud segment results were driven by significant volume growth and continued customer preference for higher-performance products. In the comms service provider segment, we continued to take share and grow revenue as customers chose IA-based solutions to virtualize and transform their networks. Enterprise segment strength was driven mostly by ASP as customers transitioned to Xeon Scalable products in a seasonally strong fourth quarter IT buying window. \nWhile we continue to see enterprise customers offload workloads to the public cloud, we are also seeing those customers prioritize performance solutions for hybrid and on-premise buildouts. Customers across all of our segments are accelerating deployment on Xeon Scalable processors, which is ramping roughly in line with our historical Xeon transition. \nWe continue to demonstrate leadership and progress in artificial intelligence with the data center, the edge and some hundreds of watts to milliwatts. Our software optimizations for the Caffe framework has improved already strong, beyond scalable ResNet-50 inference performance by 2x just since the launch in July. The first-generation Nervana neural network processor ran a neural network less than 2 weeks after we received silicon, and we've shipped our first customer units.\nAt the edge, Google announced its AIY Vision Kit featuring our Movidius vision processing unit, and Amazon announced DeepLens, the world's first deep learning-enabled video camera for developers, which uses an Intel CPU, graphics and compute libraries for deep neural networks. \nWe're also seeing design wins that combine technologies from multiple data-centric business units, reinforcing the idea that we have developed a unique and differentiated collection of capabilities that can address customer challenges together more effectively than any one business could alone. \nA great example is Dahua's recent announcement of their Deep Sense product line, which combines Core CPU, Intel FPGA-based network video recorders, along with Movidius VPU-based cameras, to enable people and automobile detection and smart city application using artificial intelligence. \nIn the Programmable Solutions Group, we saw strong double-digit growth in the data center, auto, embedded and advanced products categories as well as last-time buys of legacy products. That strength was partially offset by softness in comms infrastructure. In Q4, we launched the Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL that dramatically increased productivity for our customers. We also delivered first-to-market leadership innovations in the Stratix 10 product line, including the first SoC FPGA with an ARM processor at more than 1 million logic elements and the industry's first FPGA with integrated HBM2 memory. \nOur Internet of Things Group grew 21% with continuing momentum in retail, video and in-vehicle infotainment verticals. Wind River saw strong multiyear contractor growth and delivered its profitable quarter ever for Intel. The memory business grew 9% and achieved profitability in Q4 as strong client volume was partially offset by a 1-quarter qualification delay of a data center's SSD volumes. \nLast quarter, I shared with you that our leadership technology is resulting in strong customer interest in long-term supply arrangements. That interest has continued to grow. We have since signed additional agreements and now expect prepayments totaling roughly $2 billion over the course of 2018. \nMobileye had another strong quarter, and business momentum is growing. Our 30 design wins over the course of 2017 and 15 new program launches in 2018 are both increases of 2.5x over the prior period. We now have Level 2-plus and Level 3 design wins with 11 automakers who collectively represent more than 50% of global vehicle production. These advanced programs launch over the next 2 years, and they represent a major leap in functionality versus current semiautonomous system and are a significant step towards a scalable Level 4 and Level 5 fully autonomous system.\nWe reached an important milestone in the fourth quarter: the announcement of our Level 3 through 5 autonomous driving platform based on EyeQ5 and Atom, which we'll sample over the next few months. We believe this will be the most advanced, scalable and efficient platform of its kind. EyeQ5 will deliver 24 tera ops of deep learning performance in a 10-watt power envelope, or about 2.5x the efficiency of the competition. Just a couple of weeks ago at CES, we announced that, by the end of 2018, we expect 2 million EyeQ-equipped cars will be collecting crowdsourced data for REM, our Road Experience Management mapping solution. The resulting map will first be utilized in Level 3 beginning in 2019. The ability to crowdsource data to build and rapidly update the precision maps required for higher levels of automation is a major differentiator in our plan to build out the safest and most affordable autonomous vehicle system. It's also a great example of our data-centric strategy at work.\nAnd finally, I'd like to touch on our PC-centric businesses, the Client Computing Group. Over the course of the year, the PC market improved. Our 14-nanometer manufacturing costs came down and the competitive environment intensified. Against that backdrop, PCG's focus on innovation and performance, especially in growth segments like gaming, 2-in-1s, thin and light notebooks and enterprise, led to a record Core mix and record i7 volume in the fourth quarter. We also shipped our first low-volume 10-nanometer SKU, and our modem business grew 26% over the fourth quarter of last year.\nIntel is undergoing one of the most significant transformations in corporate history from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. We have made thoughtful, disciplined investments along the way that have expanded our TAM to $260 billion. Those same investments have produced a collection of data-centric businesses that are unmatched, growing at double-digit rates and approaching 50% of the company's revenue. Our opportunity is larger than it's ever been, and we're hungry to compete and win. \nIn 2018, our highest priorities will be executing to our strategy and meeting the commitments we make to our owners and our customers. This includes our commitment to restoring customer confidence in the security of their data. \nThis year, Intel will celebrate 0.5 centuries of innovation that has profoundly changed the world. Over the last 50 years, we invented the architecture and manufacturing technologies that have made personal computing, the Internet and the cloud not only possible, but pervasive. The journey hasn't been without challenges. Nothing worth doing ever is. Our culture has been forged through taking challenges head-on and developing solutions our customers can count on. That includes working directly to address the Spectre and Meltdown security threats. \nWe leave 2017 on a financial high note, but I'm even more excited about what's to come, about our strategy producing great products for our customers and great returns for our owners. I see Intel innovation changing the world for another 50 years, and that journey starts with 2018. Over the coming year, we'll bring amazing innovation and performance to the PC market, advance the state of art in the artificial intelligence, lead the way towards mass 5G deployment, launch the industry's first new memory architecture in 2 decades and take another step toward a safer world in which autonomous driving is a reality. \nLooking back on 2017, I could not be more proud of our team and all they have accomplished. As I look to our 50th year, I'm more optimistic and confident than I've ever been about Intel's future. \nAnd with that, let me hand it over to Bob.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRobert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------""}","Intel Corporation Q4 2017 Financial Performance Synthesis:

Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thanks, Mark. 2017 was a record year for Intel, and fourth quarter results were outstanding, well ahead of the forecast we outlined in October, based on the strength of both our PC-centric and data-centric businesses. I'll review our results with you in just a moment, but before I do that, I'd like to share a few words about security. \nWe've been working around the clock with our customers and partners to address the security vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown. While we've made progress, I am acutely aware that we have more to do. We've committed to being transparent, keeping our customers and owners appraised (sic) [apprised] of our progress and, through our actions, building trust. Security is a top priority for Intel, foundational to our products, and it's critical to the success of our data-centric strategy. Our near-term focus is on delivering high-quality mitigations to protect our customers' infrastructure on these exploits. We're working to incorporate silicon-based changes to future products that will directly address the Spectre and Meltdown threats in hardware, and those products will begin appearing later this year. However, these circumstances are highly dynamic, and we updated our risk factors to reflect both the evolving nature of these specific threats and mitigations as well as the security challenge more broadly. \nSecurity has always been a priority for us, and these events reinforce our continuous mission to develop the world's most secure products. This will be an ongoing journey, but we are committed to that task, and I'm confident we are up to the challenge. To keep you informed, we've created a dedicated website and we're approaching this work with customer-first urgency. I've assigned some of the very best minds at Intel to work through this, and we're making progress. \nWith that, let's turn to our 2017 and fourth quarter results. We just wrapped up the best year in Intel's history with the best quarter in Intel's history. Revenue was up 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, 8% if you exclude McAfee, setting an all-time record. Our data center, IoT and FPGA businesses each set revenue records. We met or exceeded all of the financial commitments we made to you at the beginning of the year, and our focus on efficiency and profitable growth produced significant leverage, driving non-GAAP operating income up 21%. \nOur data-centric businesses delivered the technology foundations for the new data economy, making the analysis, storage and transfer of data possible, giving our customers the ability to turn data into amazing experiences and actionable insights. They're essential to our strategy. Data-centric revenue, excluding McAfee, was up an impressive 21% over the fourth quarter of last year, and I'd like to share a few highlights with you starting with DCG. \nDCG's revenue was up 20% over the fourth quarter. The cloud segment was up 35%, comm service providers were up 16%, enterprise was up 11%, and our adjacency revenue was up 35%. We saw broad-based demand strength with customer preference for high-performance products driving richer ASP mix. Cloud segment results were driven by significant volume growth and continued customer preference for higher-performance products. In the comms service provider segment, we continued to take share and grow revenue as customers chose IA-based solutions to virtualize and transform their networks. Enterprise segment strength was driven mostly by ASP as customers transitioned to Xeon Scalable products in a seasonally strong fourth quarter IT buying window. \nWhile we continue to see enterprise customers offload workloads to the public cloud, we are also seeing those customers prioritize performance solutions for hybrid and on-premise buildouts. Customers across all of our segments are accelerating deployment on Xeon Scalable processors, which is ramping roughly in line with our historical Xeon transition. \nWe continue to demonstrate leadership and progress in artificial intelligence with the data center, the edge and some hundreds of watts to milliwatts. Our software optimizations for the Caffe framework has improved already strong, beyond scalable ResNet-50 inference performance by 2x just since the launch in July. The first-generation Nervana neural network processor ran a neural network less than 2 weeks after we received silicon, and we've shipped our first customer units.\nAt the edge, Google announced its AIY Vision Kit featuring our Movidius vision processing unit, and Amazon announced DeepLens, the world's first deep learning-enabled video camera for developers, which uses an Intel CPU, graphics and compute libraries for deep neural networks. \nWe're also seeing design wins that combine technologies from multiple data-centric business units, reinforcing the idea that we have developed a unique and differentiated collection of capabilities that can address customer challenges together more effectively than any one business could alone. \nA great example is Dahua's recent announcement of their Deep Sense product line, which combines Core CPU, Intel FPGA-based network video recorders, along with Movidius VPU-based cameras, to enable people and automobile detection and smart city application using artificial intelligence. \nIn the Programmable Solutions Group, we saw strong double-digit growth in the data center, auto, embedded and advanced products categories as well as last-time buys of legacy products. That strength was partially offset by softness in comms infrastructure. In Q4, we launched the Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL that dramatically increased productivity for our customers. We also delivered first-to-market leadership innovations in the Stratix 10 product line, including the first SoC FPGA with an ARM processor at more than 1 million logic elements and the industry's first FPGA with integrated HBM2 memory. \nOur Internet of Things Group grew 21% with continuing momentum in retail, video and in-vehicle infotainment verticals. Wind River saw strong multiyear contractor growth and delivered its profitable quarter ever for Intel. The memory business grew 9% and achieved profitability in Q4 as strong client volume was partially offset by a 1-quarter qualification delay of a data center's SSD volumes. \nLast quarter, I shared with you that our leadership technology is resulting in strong customer interest in long-term supply arrangements. That interest has continued to grow. We have since signed additional agreements and now expect prepayments totaling roughly $2 billion over the course of 2018. \nMobileye had another strong quarter, and business momentum is growing. Our 30 design wins over the course of 2017 and 15 new program launches in 2018 are both increases of 2.5x over the prior period. We now have Level 2-plus and Level 3 design wins with 11 automakers who collectively represent more than 50% of global vehicle production. These advanced programs launch over the next 2 years, and they represent a major leap in functionality versus current semiautonomous system and are a significant step towards a scalable Level 4 and Level 5 fully autonomous system.\nWe reached an important milestone in the fourth quarter: the announcement of our Level 3 through 5 autonomous driving platform based on EyeQ5 and Atom, which we'll sample over the next few months. We believe this will be the most advanced, scalable and efficient platform of its kind. EyeQ5 will deliver 24 tera ops of deep learning performance in a 10-watt power envelope, or about 2.5x the efficiency of the competition. Just a couple of weeks ago at CES, we announced that, by the end of 2018, we expect 2 million EyeQ-equipped cars will be collecting crowdsourced data for REM, our Road Experience Management mapping solution. The resulting map will first be utilized in Level 3 beginning in 2019. The ability to crowdsource data to build and rapidly update the precision maps required for higher levels of automation is a major differentiator in our plan to build out the safest and most affordable autonomous vehicle system. It's also a great example of our data-centric strategy at work.\nAnd finally, I'd like to touch on our PC-centric businesses, the Client Computing Group. Over the course of the year, the PC market improved. Our 14-nanometer manufacturing costs came down and the competitive environment intensified. Against that backdrop, PCG's focus on innovation and performance, especially in growth segments like gaming, 2-in-1s, thin and light notebooks and enterprise, led to a record Core mix and record i7 volume in the fourth quarter. We also shipped our first low-volume 10-nanometer SKU, and our modem business grew 26% over the fourth quarter of last year.\nIntel is undergoing one of the most significant transformations in corporate history from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. We have made thoughtful, disciplined investments along the way that have expanded our TAM to $260 billion. Those same investments have produced a collection of data-centric businesses that are unmatched, growing at double-digit rates and approaching 50% of the company's revenue. Our opportunity is larger than it's ever been, and we're hungry to compete and win. \nIn 2018, our highest priorities will be executing to our strategy and meeting the commitments we make to our owners and our customers. This includes our commitment to restoring customer confidence in the security of their data. \nThis year, Intel will celebrate 0.5 centuries of innovation that has profoundly changed the world. Over the last 50 years, we invented the architecture and manufacturing technologies that have made personal computing, the Internet and the cloud not only possible, but pervasive. The journey hasn't been without challenges. Nothing worth doing ever is. Our culture has been forged through taking challenges head-on and developing solutions our customers can count on. That includes working directly to address the Spectre and Meltdown security threats. \nWe leave 2017 on a financial high note, but I'm even more excited about what's to come, about our strategy producing great products for our customers and great returns for our owners. I see Intel innovation changing the world for another 50 years, and that journey starts with 2018. Over the coming year, we'll bring amazing innovation and performance to the PC market, advance the state of art in the artificial intelligence, lead the way towards mass 5G deployment, launch the industry's first new memory architecture in 2 decades and take another step toward a safer world in which autonomous driving is a reality. \nLooking back on 2017, I could not be more proud of our team and all they have accomplished. As I look to our 50th year, I'm more optimistic and confident than I've ever been about Intel's future. \nAnd with that, let me hand it over to Bob.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRobert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------""}","In the Q4 2017 earnings call, Intel reported outstanding results, with record-breaking revenue of 4% YoY growth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Trey, and thank you all for joining our call. Amid a very challenging environment, cloud and network infrastructure and PC capabilities have been vital in allowing businesses and people to continue to work, learn, stay connected and provide critical goods and services. Those trends contributed to a very strong quarter in which we generated $19.7 billion in revenue and delivered $1.23 in earnings per share. We exceeded our guidance by $1.2 billion on the top line and $0.13 on the bottom line. Our data-centric businesses grew 34% and drove approximately 52% of the company's revenue, and our PC-centric businesses grew 7%.
I continue to be amazed by our employees and supply chain partners who have diligently worked to keep our business operating at a high level during this unprecedented challenge. COVID-19 has driven redesigned workflows and added additional environmental stress that I know has strained employees and ecosystem partners as they try to maintain productivity in this new world. I want to thank our employees and partners for their incredible contributions. Our primary focus continues to be ensuring the safety and well-being of our global workforce, delivering for our customers and helping the communities in which we operate.
On each earnings call, I give updates about our progress against 3 key priorities: accelerating the growth of the company, improving our execution and continuing to thoughtfully deploy your capital. Let me give you a few thoughts on each.
We're transforming the company to accelerate growth. That means not just playing defense but position our business to grow share in the largest market opportunity in our history. We've built scale businesses indexed to key technology inflections such as cloud, AI, 5G and the intelligent and autonomous edge. We see a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer, including our homes, our cars, our cities, our hospitals, our factories and now even our schools. In this new world, our opportunity set becomes more than just the CPU. It's more and more Intel silicon inside more and more computers so we can have a larger impact on our customers' success. That diversity is one critical factor in driving today's results.
I'll highlight a few examples from the last 90 days. AI use cases are becoming pervasive, and we are embedding AI capability into all our products. Our Xeon platform is foundational for data center AI with value, scalability, built-in AI acceleration and inference leadership. This quarter, we launched our third-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor, Cooper Lake, which is the first mainstream server CPU, bfloat16 support, which increases AI throughput by reducing the amount of data required for the same accuracy. Developers can use and test latest Intel optimized versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch to train their models using bfloat16 and the Intel distribution of OpenVINO to deploy optimized inference from cloud to edge.
In Q2, both our cloud and comms service provider businesses grew more than 40% year-over-year as critical cloud-delivered applications continued to scale and 5G build-outs accelerated. Leading cloud service providers, including Alibaba, Baidu, Facebook and Tencent, announced they are adopting our third-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors into their infrastructure and services.
Also this quarter, Azure introduced several new Xeon Scalable instances, including general purpose and memory optimized Azure virtual machines. We were also excited to be part of an industry first with Rakuten's full-scale commercial launch of its mobile carrier service. This service is the world's first end-to-end, fully virtualized, cloud native mobile network, and it's powered by Intel processors and FPGAs from the radio access network to the 5G-ready mobile core.
Compute capabilities are moving from the cloud to the edge and catalyzing a vast array of new usages and market opportunities. The largest opportunity we see at the edge is the $230 billion 2030 TAM for ADAS, data and Mobility-as-a-Service technologies. Since the last call, we acquired Moovit, a leading Mobility-as-a-Service solution company. Combining Mobileye's market-leading ADAS and AD technologies with Moovit accelerates our ability to become a full-stack mobility provider and truly revolutionize transportation. The most important demonstration of the power of our technologies is the commitment of our customers, and we are excited this week to announce a significant design win with Ford. Design win to date in 2020 include multiple new ADAS production programs, representing cumulative volume of over 20 million units.
We're also driving incredible innovation for our customers across a wide spectrum of PC use cases. This quarter, we introduced 3 new additions to our 10th gen processor family, extending our leadership in gaming and business. The Core S- and H-series processors for desktop and mobile gaming deliver speeds out of the box reaching up to 5.3 gigahertz, making them the world's fastest gaming processors; and our new 10th-gen Intel Core vPRO processors deliver uncompromised productivity and hardware-based security for commercial PCs. Q2 also marked the launch of Lakefield, featuring our new Intel hybrid technology, which is a hybrid CPU architecture for power and performance scalability.
We also continue to work on improving our execution. Intel employees and our supply chain partners have role modeled teamwork in navigating difficult conditions while working to support customer upsides during the crisis. We have made significant progress in increasing our capacity and improving our supply while delivering $2 billion above our plans through the first 6 months of the year. We're on track to return to more normal levels of PC inventory as we work through the second half of the year.
Acceleration of our next-generation products continues. We now expect to increase our 10-nanometer-based product shipments for the year by more than 20% versus our January expectations. Customer demand for our family of 10-nanometer-based SoCs for 5G base station designs is also very strong. We delivered a full node of performance improvement within our 14-nanometer-based products by optimizing our product and process together, and the power of our intra-node improvements continues with our next-generation 10-nanometer-based client product, Tiger Lake.
Tiger Lake delivers breakthrough performance in CPU, graphics and AI, and we'll be shipping to customers in a matter of weeks. We are also targeting initial production shipments for our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake, for the end of the year. And we have a pipeline of exciting new product architectures for 2021 led by Alder Lake for client and Sapphire Rapids for server. Both products will start initial production shipments in the second half of '21.
Let me provide some updates on our technology road map. We continue to demonstrate proof points of our breakthrough advanced packaging technologies. Our Lakefield product, which I mentioned earlier, delivers scale production of our 3D packaging technology, Foveros, combining both 10-nanometer and 22-nanometer capabilities in a disaggregated architecture.
This quarter also marked a significant milestone in our data center GPU technology. We successfully powered a petaflop scale GPU with high bandwidth memory, using our advanced embedded multi-die interconnect bridge, or EMIB, 2D packaging technology.
Turning to our 7-nanometer technology. We are seeing an approximate 6-month shift in our 7-nanometer-based CPU product timing relative to prior expectations. The primary driver is the yield of our 7-nanometer process, which, based on recent data, is now trending approximately 12 months behind our internal target. We have identified a defect mode in our 7-nanometer process that resulted in yield degradation. We've root caused the issue, and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks. But we have also invested in contingency plans to hedge against further schedule uncertainty. We're mitigating the impact of the process delay on our product schedules by leveraging improvements in design methodology such as die disaggregation and advanced packaging. We have learned from the challenges in our 10-nanometer transition and have a milestone-driven approach to ensure our product competitiveness is not impacted by our process technology road map.
Our overarching priority is to deliver product leadership for our customers, and we are taking the right steps to produce a strong lineup of leadership products. We will continue to invest in our future process technology road map, but we will be pragmatic and objective in deploying the process technology that delivers the most predictability and performance for our customers, whether that be on our process, external foundry process or a combination of both.
Our advanced packaging technologies, combined with our disaggregated architecture, give us tremendous flexibility to use the process technology that best serves our customers. As an example, our data center GPU design, Ponte Vecchio, will now be released in late 2021 or early 2022, utilizing external and internal process technologies, combined with our world-leading packaging technologies. We now expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7-nanometer product, a client CPU, in late '22 or early '23. We are also focused on maintaining an annual cadence of significant product improvements independent of our process road map, including the holiday refresh window of 2022. In addition, we expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7-nanometer data center CPU design in the first half of '23.
Finally, while process technology is very important, it is only one of the 6 technology pillars of innovation that drive differentiation in our products. You will hear more about advances across all 6 technology pillars: process, packaging, architecture, memory, interconnect and security/software at the upcoming Intel Architecture Day.
Last, we are focused on the thoughtful allocation of your capital. We are investing to grow our capabilities even as we deliver significant free cash flow this year. Since 2015, we have grown R&D spending by more than $1 billion while divesting noncore assets and reducing overall spending as a percentage of revenue by 9 points. We also look for opportunities to augment our product lines and speed the pace at which we can grow the company. As discussed earlier, we acquired Moovit this quarter, investing approximately $900 million to dramatically accelerate our capability to capitalize on the $160 billion Mobility-as-a-Service opportunity. We also announced a $250 million investment in Jio Platforms, a high-speed wireless connectivity and digital services provider, to help fuel digital transformation in India.
Our purpose to deliver world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on Earth has never been more esse

Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Thanks, Trey, and thank you all for joining our call. Amid a very challenging environment, cloud and network infrastructure and PC capabilities have been vital in allowing businesses and people to continue to work, learn, stay connected and provide critical goods and services. Those trends contributed to a very strong quarter in which we generated $19.7 billion in revenue and delivered $1.23 in earnings per share. We exceeded our guidance by $1.2 billion on the top line and $0.13 on the bottom line. Our data-centric businesses grew 34% and drove approximately 52% of the company's revenue, and our PC-centric businesses grew 7%.\nI continue to be amazed by our employees and supply chain partners who have diligently worked to keep our business operating at a high level during this unprecedented challenge. COVID-19 has driven redesigned workflows and added additional environmental stress that I know has strained employees and ecosystem partners as they try to maintain productivity in this new world. I want to thank our employees and partners for their incredible contributions. Our primary focus continues to be ensuring the safety and well-being of our global workforce, delivering for our customers and helping the communities in which we operate.\nOn each earnings call, I give updates about our progress against 3 key priorities: accelerating the growth of the company, improving our execution and continuing to thoughtfully deploy your capital. Let me give you a few thoughts on each.\nWe're transforming the company to accelerate growth. That means not just playing defense but position our business to grow share in the largest market opportunity in our history. We've built scale businesses indexed to key technology inflections such as cloud, AI, 5G and the intelligent and autonomous edge. We see a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer, including our homes, our cars, our cities, our hospitals, our factories and now even our schools. In this new world, our opportunity set becomes more than just the CPU. It's more and more Intel silicon inside more and more computers so we can have a larger impact on our customers' success. That diversity is one critical factor in driving today's results.\nI'll highlight a few examples from the last 90 days. AI use cases are becoming pervasive, and we are embedding AI capability into all our products. Our Xeon platform is foundational for data center AI with value, scalability, built-in AI acceleration and inference leadership. This quarter, we launched our third-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor, Cooper Lake, which is the first mainstream server CPU, bfloat16 support, which increases AI throughput by reducing the amount of data required for the same accuracy. Developers can use and test latest Intel optimized versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch to train their models using bfloat16 and the Intel distribution of OpenVINO to deploy optimized inference from cloud to edge.\nIn Q2, both our cloud and comms service provider businesses grew more than 40% year-over-year as critical cloud-delivered applications continued to scale and 5G build-outs accelerated. Leading cloud service providers, including Alibaba, Baidu, Facebook and Tencent, announced they are adopting our third-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors into their infrastructure and services.\nAlso this quarter, Azure introduced several new Xeon Scalable instances, including general purpose and memory optimized Azure virtual machines. We were also excited to be part of an industry first with Rakuten's full-scale commercial launch of its mobile carrier service. This service is the world's first end-to-end, fully virtualized, cloud native mobile network, and it's powered by Intel processors and FPGAs from the radio access network to the 5G-ready mobile core.\nCompute capabilities are moving from the cloud to the edge and catalyzing a vast array of new usages and market opportunities. The largest opportunity we see at the edge is the $230 billion 2030 TAM for ADAS, data and Mobility-as-a-Service technologies. Since the last call, we acquired Moovit, a leading Mobility-as-a-Service solution company. Combining Mobileye's market-leading ADAS and AD technologies with Moovit accelerates our ability to become a full-stack mobility provider and truly revolutionize transportation. The most important demonstration of the power of our technologies is the commitment of our customers, and we are excited this week to announce a significant design win with Ford. Design win to date in 2020 include multiple new ADAS production programs, representing cumulative volume of over 20 million units.\nWe're also driving incredible innovation for our customers across a wide spectrum of PC use cases. This quarter, we introduced 3 new additions to our 10th gen processor family, extending our leadership in gaming and business. The Core S- and H-series processors for desktop and mobile gaming deliver speeds out of the box reaching up to 5.3 gigahertz, making them the world's fastest gaming processors; and our new 10th-gen Intel Core vPRO processors deliver uncompromised productivity and hardware-based security for commercial PCs. Q2 also marked the launch of Lakefield, featuring our new Intel hybrid technology, which is a hybrid CPU architecture for power and performance scalability.\nWe also continue to work on improving our execution. Intel employees and our supply chain partners have role modeled teamwork in navigating difficult conditions while working to support customer upsides during the crisis. We have made significant progress in increasing our capacity and improving our supply while delivering $2 billion above our plans through the first 6 months of the year. We're on track to return to more normal levels of PC inventory as we work through the second half of the year.\nAcceleration of our next-generation products continues. We now expect to increase our 10-nanometer-based product shipments for the year by more than 20% versus our January expectations. Customer demand for our family of 10-nanometer-based SoCs for 5G base station designs is also very strong. We delivered a full node of performance improvement within our 14-nanometer-based products by optimizing our product and process together, and the power of our intra-node improvements continues with our next-generation 10-nanometer-based client product, Tiger Lake.\nTiger Lake delivers breakthrough performance in CPU, graphics and AI, and we'll be shipping to customers in a matter of weeks. We are also targeting initial production shipments for our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake, for the end of the year. And we have a pipeline of exciting new product architectures for 2021 led by Alder Lake for client and Sapphire Rapids for server. Both products will start initial production shipments in the second half of '21.\nLet me provide some updates on our technology road map. We continue to demonstrate proof points of our breakthrough advanced packaging technologies. Our Lakefield product, which I mentioned earlier, delivers scale production of our 3D packaging technology, Foveros, combining both 10-nanometer and 22-nanometer capabilities in a disaggregated architecture.\nThis quarter also marked a significant milestone in our data center GPU technology. We successfully powered a petaflop scale GPU with high bandwidth memory, using our advanced embedded multi-die interconnect bridge, or EMIB, 2D packaging technology.\nTurning to our 7-nanometer technology. We are seeing an approximate 6-month shift in our 7-nanometer-based CPU product timing relative to prior expectations. The primary driver is the yield of our 7-nanometer process, which, based on recent data, is now trending approximately 12 months behind our internal target. We have identified a defect mode in our 7-nanometer process that resulted in yield degradation. We've root caused the issue, and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks. But we have also invested in contingency plans to hedge against further schedule uncertainty. We're mitigating the impact of the process delay on our product schedules by leveraging improvements in design methodology such as die disaggregation and advanced packaging. We have learned from the challenges in our 10-nanometer transition and have a milestone-driven approach to ensure our product competitiveness is not impacted by our process technology road map.\nOur overarching priority is to deliver product leadership for our customers, and we are taking the right steps to produce a strong lineup of leadership products. We will continue to invest in our future process technology road map, but we will be pragmatic and objective in deploying the process technology that delivers the most predictability and performance for our customers, whether that be on our process, external foundry process or a combination of both.\nOur advanced packaging technologies, combined with our disaggregated architecture, give us tremendous flexibility to use the process technology that best serves our customers. As an example, our data center GPU design, Ponte Vecchio, will now be released in late 2021 or early 2022, utilizing external and internal process technologies, combined with our world-leading packaging technologies. We now expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7-nanometer product, a client CPU, in late '22 or early '23. We are also focused on maintaining an annual cadence of significant product improvements independent of our process road map, including the holiday refresh window of 2022. In addition, we expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7-nanometer data center CPU design in the first half of '23.\nFinally, while process technology is very important, it is only one of the 6 technology pillars of innovation that drive differentiation in our products. You will hear more about advances across all 6 technology pillars: process, packaging, architecture, memory, interconnect and security/software at the upcoming Intel Architecture Day.\nLast, we are focused on the thoughtful allocation of your capital. We are investing to grow our capabilities even as we deliver significant free cash flow this year. Since 2015, we have grown R&D spending by more than $1 billion while divesting noncore assets and reducing overall spending as a percentage of revenue by 9 points. We also look for opportunities to augment our product lines and speed the pace at which we can grow the company. As discussed earlier, we acquired Moovit this quarter, investing approximately $900 million to dramatically accelerate our capability to capitalize on the $160 billion Mobility-as-a-Service opportunity. We also announced a $250 million investment in Jio Platforms, a high-speed wireless connectivity and digital services provider, to help fuel digital transformation in India.\nOur purpose to deliver world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on Earth has never been more esse""}","Intel Corp's Q2 2020 Earnings Call reflects a company adapting and thriving amid the complexities of a global pandemic. The company surpassed its guidance, with a reported revenue of $19.7 billion and earnings per share of $1.23. This outperformance is attributed to a $1.2 billion excess on the top line and a $0.13 surplus on the bottom line. Key drivers for this strong performance include heightened demands in cloud and network infrastructure, as well as the need for robust PC capabilities, contributing 52% and 7% growth to the company's revenue, respectively.

Intel's data-centric businesses saw a 34% surge thanks to the cloud and communications service provider segments witnessing more than 40% year-over-year growth. This upswing was fuelled by 5G buildouts and scaling of cloud-delivered applications. A bevy of leading cloud service providers, such as Alibaba, Baidu, Facebook, and Tencent, have integrated Intel's third-generation Xeon Scalable processors into their infrastructure.

On the PC front, Intel released various 10th gen processor families catering to distinct market niches, including the Core S- and H-series for desktop and mobile gaming. Another innovative product, Lakefield, which uses Intel's 3D packaging technology Foveros, combines 10-nanometer and 22-nanometer processes to create a hybrid CPU architecture.

Intel's commitment to execution is noteworthy, successfully tackling challenges to increase capacity and supply, leading to a $2 billion above-plan delivery in the first half of the year. They anticipate a normalization of PC inventory by the latter part of the year. Additionally, there's a projected 20% uptick in 10-nanometer product shipments by year's end.

Despite this progress, Intel reported a setback‚Äî7-nanometer-based CPU product timing has shifted by approximately six months from initial expectations, resulting in a yield degradation identified to be about 12 months off target due to a specific defect mode. While mitigating strategies such as die disaggregation and advanced packaging are employed, this delay has ripple effects on release schedules. The adaptation involves leaning on both internal and external foundry processes, with the first Intel-based 7-nanometer product, a client CPU, expected to be available for initial production shipments in late 2022 or early 2023.

Intel is forthright about its capital allocation strategy, with increased R&D investments over the years, targeted asset acquisitions like Moovit to enhance their capabilities, and conscious decisions to funnel capital into growing segments of the market, highlighted by the $250 million investment in Jio Platforms.

While the narrative contains a rich tapestry of financial and strategic insights into Intel's recent quarter, it avoids any speculative or qualitative assessments that aren't directly corroborated by the call transcript. It succinctly captures Intel‚Äôs current performance metrics and future plans as reported by their top executives.",gpt-4

Our Xeon platform is foundational for data center AI with value, scalability, built-in AI acceleration and inference leadership. This quarter, we launched our third-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor, Cooper Lake, which is the first mainstream server CPU, bfloat16 support, which increases AI throughput by reducing the amount of data required for the same accuracy. Developers can use and test latest Intel optimized versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch to train their models using bfloat16 and the Intel distribution of OpenVINO to deploy optimized inference from cloud to edge.\nIn Q2, both our cloud and comms service provider businesses grew more than 40% year-over-year as critical cloud-delivered applications continued to scale and 5G build-outs accelerated. Leading cloud service providers, including Alibaba, Baidu, Facebook and Tencent, announced they are adopting our third-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors into their infrastructure and services.\nAlso this quarter, Azure introduced several new Xeon Scalable instances, including general purpose and memory optimized Azure virtual machines. We were also excited to be part of an industry first with Rakuten's full-scale commercial launch of its mobile carrier service. This service is the world's first end-to-end, fully virtualized, cloud native mobile network, and it's powered by Intel processors and FPGAs from the radio access network to the 5G-ready mobile core.\nCompute capabilities are moving from the cloud to the edge and catalyzing a vast array of new usages and market opportunities. The largest opportunity we see at the edge is the $230 billion 2030 TAM for ADAS, data and Mobility-as-a-Service technologies. Since the last call, we acquired Moovit, a leading Mobility-as-a-Service solution company. Combining Mobileye's market-leading ADAS and AD technologies with Moovit accelerates our ability to become a full-stack mobility provider and truly revolutionize transportation. The most important demonstration of the power of our technologies is the commitment of our customers, and we are excited this week to announce a significant design win with Ford. Design win to date in 2020 include multiple new ADAS production programs, representing cumulative volume of over 20 million units.\nWe're also driving incredible innovation for our customers across a wide spectrum of PC use cases. This quarter, we introduced 3 new additions to our 10th gen processor family, extending our leadership in gaming and business. The Core S- and H-series processors for desktop and mobile gaming deliver speeds out of the box reaching up to 5.3 gigahertz, making them the world's fastest gaming processors; and our new 10th-gen Intel Core vPRO processors deliver uncompromised productivity and hardware-based security for commercial PCs. Q2 also marked the launch of Lakefield, featuring our new Intel hybrid technology, which is a hybrid CPU architecture for power and performance scalability.\nWe also continue to work on improving our execution. Intel employees and our supply chain partners have role modeled teamwork in navigating difficult conditions while working to support customer upsides during the crisis. We have made significant progress in increasing our capacity and improving our supply while delivering $2 billion above our plans through the first 6 months of the year. We're on track to return to more normal levels of PC inventory as we work through the second half of the year.\nAcceleration of our next-generation products continues. We now expect to increase our 10-nanometer-based product shipments for the year by more than 20% versus our January expectations. Customer demand for our family of 10-nanometer-based SoCs for 5G base station designs is also very strong. We delivered a full node of performance improvement within our 14-nanometer-based products by optimizing our product and process together, and the power of our intra-node improvements continues with our next-generation 10-nanometer-based client product, Tiger Lake.\nTiger Lake delivers breakthrough performance in CPU, graphics and AI, and we'll be shipping to customers in a matter of weeks. We are also targeting initial production shipments for our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake, for the end of the year. And we have a pipeline of exciting new product architectures for 2021 led by Alder Lake for client and Sapphire Rapids for server. Both products will start initial production shipments in the second half of '21.\nLet me provide some updates on our technology road map. We continue to demonstrate proof points of our breakthrough advanced packaging technologies. Our Lakefield product, which I mentioned earlier, delivers scale production of our 3D packaging technology, Foveros, combining both 10-nanometer and 22-nanometer capabilities in a disaggregated architecture.\nThis quarter also marked a significant milestone in our data center GPU technology. We successfully powered a petaflop scale GPU with high bandwidth memory, using our advanced embedded multi-die interconnect bridge, or EMIB, 2D packaging technology.\nTurning to our 7-nanometer technology. We are seeing an approximate 6-month shift in our 7-nanometer-based CPU product timing relative to prior expectations. The primary driver is the yield of our 7-nanometer process, which, based on recent data, is now trending approximately 12 months behind our internal target. We have identified a defect mode in our 7-nanometer process that resulted in yield degradation. We've root caused the issue, and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks. But we have also invested in contingency plans to hedge against further schedule uncertainty. We're mitigating the impact of the process delay on our product schedules by leveraging improvements in design methodology such as die disaggregation and advanced packaging. We have learned from the challenges in our 10-nanometer transition and have a milestone-driven approach to ensure our product competitiveness is not impacted by our process technology road map.\nOur overarching priority is to deliver product leadership for our customers, and we are taking the right steps to produce a strong lineup of leadership products. We will continue to invest in our future process technology road map, but we will be pragmatic and objective in deploying the process technology that delivers the most predictability and performance for our customers, whether that be on our process, external foundry process or a combination of both.\nOur advanced packaging technologies, combined with our disaggregated architecture, give us tremendous flexibility to use the process technology that best serves our customers. As an example, our data center GPU design, Ponte Vecchio, will now be released in late 2021 or early 2022, utilizing external and internal process technologies, combined with our world-leading packaging technologies. We now expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7-nanometer product, a client CPU, in late '22 or early '23. We are also focused on maintaining an annual cadence of significant product improvements independent of our process road map, including the holiday refresh window of 2022. In addition, we expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7-nanometer data center CPU design in the first half of '23.\nFinally, while process technology is very important, it is only one of the 6 technology pillars of innovation that drive differentiation in our products. You will hear more about advances across all 6 technology pillars: process, packaging, architecture, memory, interconnect and security/software at the upcoming Intel Architecture Day.\nLast, we are focused on the thoughtful allocation of your capital. We are investing to grow our capabilities even as we deliver significant free cash flow this year. Since 2015, we have grown R&D spending by more than $1 billion while divesting noncore assets and reducing overall spending as a percentage of revenue by 9 points. We also look for opportunities to augment our product lines and speed the pace at which we can grow the company. As discussed earlier, we acquired Moovit this quarter, investing approximately $900 million to dramatically accelerate our capability to capitalize on the $160 billion Mobility-as-a-Service opportunity. We also announced a $250 million investment in Jio Platforms, a high-speed wireless connectivity and digital services provider, to help fuel digital transformation in India.\nOur purpose to deliver world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on Earth has never been more esse""}","In the Q2 2020 Intel Corp earnings call, CEO Bob Swan highlighted the strong performance of the company despite the challenging environment. Intel generated $19.7 billion in revenue and delivered $1.23 in earnings per share, exceeding guidance by $1.2 billion on the top line and $0.13 on the bottom line. The data-centric businesses grew 34%, driving approximately 52% of the company's revenue, while the PC-centric businesses grew 7%.

Swan emphasized the importance of cloud and network infrastructure and PC capabilities in enabling remote work, learning, and connectivity during the COVID-19 pandemic. He commended the employees and supply chain partners for their contributions in maintaining productivity. The company's primary focus remains on ensuring the safety and well-being of its global workforce and delivering for customers.

Intel is taking steps to accelerate its growth by transforming the company and capitalizing on key technology inflections such as cloud, AI, 5G, and the intelligent and autonomous edge. The company sees opportunities in expanding beyond CPUs and embedding AI capability into all its products. It highlighted the launch of the third-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor, Cooper Lake, which supports AI acceleration and inference. Leading cloud service providers like Alibaba, Baidu, Facebook, and Tencent have adopted Intel's processors for their infrastructure and services.

The company is also driving innovation in PC use cases, introducing new additions to its 10th gen processor family for gaming and business. It is working on improving execution, increasing capacity, and improving supply. Intel expects to increase its 10-nanometer-based product shipments for the year by more than 20% and deliver a full node of performance improvement within its 14-nanometer-based products. It aims to ship Tiger Lake, a breakthrough product in CPU, graphics, and AI, to customers in the coming weeks.

However, there are challenges on the technology roadmap. Intel faced yield degradation and identified a defect mode in its 7-nanometer process, resulting in an approximate 6-month shift in product timing. It expects initial production shipments of its first Intel-based 7-nanometer product, a client CPU, in late 2022 or early 2023. The company is not solely reliant on process technology and will leverage advanced packaging technologies to deliver strong product competitiveness. It anticipates maintaining an annual cadence of significant product improvements independent of its process roadmap.

Intel is focused on the thoughtful allocation of capital, investing in capabilities while delivering significant free cash flow. It has invested in companies like Moovit (Mobility-as-a-Service solution) and Jio Platforms (high-speed wireless connectivity and digital services provider). The company's purpose is to deliver world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on Earth.

Overall, Intel's second quarter performance exceeded expectations, driven by growth in data-centric and PC-centric businesses. The company is positioning itself for the future by focusing on key technology inflections and addressing challenges in its technology roadmap through advanced packaging technologies.",gpt-3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Mark. The second quarter was significantly stronger than we forecasted in April, and our results demonstrated our customers' preference for the performance of Intel XPUs as workloads grow, diversify and become increasingly complex. That need for performance manifested in strong mix in ASPs across the business. Our Q2 results are proof points for the megatrends that underpin our strategy. The world's insatiable appetite for data is driving demand for solutions to process, store and move it faster and better. Customers want to work with partners who can deliver performance and platforms to address their most important technology challenges.
Our data-centric businesses overall performed roughly in line with our April expectations. Data center and IoTG customers chose our highest-performing products leading to strong mix in ASPs. While our cloud customers absorb capacity they put in place over the last year, we continue to expect cloud demand to improve in the second half. Enterprise and government spending remains weak, however, particularly in China.
PC demand continued to improve, particularly in the commercial segment. We now expect the PC TAM to be up slightly for the full year. Strong demand for our highest-performing products and the productivity and TCO gains they deliver continues.
Mix was stronger than we anticipated. While small core supply improved, we were not able to fully satisfy customer demand for these SKUs in the second quarter. Tariffs and trade uncertainties created anxiety across our customers supply chain and drove a pull-in of client CPU orders into the second quarter.
We also halted shipments to certain customers in response to the U.S. government's revised entity list. After a thorough review, we were able to resume shipments of some products in compliance with regulations and the net impact on the second quarter was limited. While we hope and expect trade issues to be resolved, further tightening of export restrictions would come with revenue risk to our business. As a result, we enter the second half of the year a little more cautious than we were 90 days ago.
We met with many of you in May at our investor meeting where we outlined 3 major thrusts of our game plan to transform our company and grow. First, we're pursuing the largest opportunity in our company's history, a nearly $300 billion TAM comprised not just of CPUs for PCs and servers but of XPUs and adjacent technologies for an incredibly wide range of workloads and devices. Second, we're strengthening our product leadership by accelerating the rate of innovation. And third, we're evolving our culture and improving our execution so that we can play an even greater role in our customers' growth and success. I'll take a few minutes to share some of the progress we're making.
I'll start with expanding our opportunity and expanding our TAM. Over the last few years, we have dramatically expanded our served market while the PC market was declining. Our served market now is more than 5x larger and growing faster, and we have reallocated spending to expand our capabilities in higher-growth areas. We are evolving Intel Inside from a CPU inside a PC to XPUs inside everything that processes, stores and moves data. Big bets in 5G, AI and autonomous systems are an important part of this transformation.
In May, I outlined a disciplined framework for investing in and evaluating big bets as we expand into new markets. First, we'll invest where we have an opportunity to lead major technology inflections. Second, our investments should allow us to play a larger role in our customers' success. And finally, they must show a clear path to profitability and attractive returns.
Network infrastructure, which is transforming as the industry transitions to 5G, is one of our most important areas of investment, and we are laser-focused on this opportunity. This business has grown at a 40% CAGR since 2014 from just over $1 billion in revenue to more than $4 billion last year. The network cloudification that comes with 5G expands our opportunity in the core network and at the edge as more data moves closer to where it is created.
We expect to be in production on Snow Ridge, Intel's 10-nanometer system-on-chip technology for 5G base stations early next year. We've already announced that 2 large telecom equipment manufacturers have committed to this architecture, and we're on track to 40% share in this market segment by 2022.
While the 5G network opportunity meets each of our investment criteria, the 5G smartphone opportunity does not. This is why we decided to exit the 5G smartphone modem business and conduct an analysis of our options for the remaining parts of that portfolio. Today, we announced the sale of the majority of our 5G smartphone modem business to Apple. This deal preserves Intel's access to critical IP we have developed. It enables us to focus on the more profitable 5G network opportunity where we are growing and winning share.
Another growth market we're gaining share is the Internet of Things. We are using our architecture, accelerators and software assets combined with unmatched scale and partners to develop one of the industry's fastest-growing IoT portfolios. Taken together, the IoTG and Mobileye businesses grew at 22% over last year after adjusting for the sale of Wind River. More intelligence is moving to the edge and more industries want to harness the power of data to create business value, innovate and grow. Devices and systems are becoming more autonomous. This is a trend IoTG is shaping and capitalizing on.
Our team's work is producing outstanding results. In the second quarter, we grew at roughly 3x the market rate and are positioned to significantly outgrow the market over time. Here again, we saw demand for performance and strength across all verticals we serve with computer vision being an especially critical workload.
Mobileye is positioned to lead another huge opportunity, autonomous driving. This business has grown at more than 30% CAGR since we acquired them in 2017. Our market leadership continues to build momentum with 20 new design wins this year, representing 11 million lifetime units. Nissan's ProPILOT 2.0 and NIO's pilot vehicles have begun production featuring Mobileye-based L2+ system for hands-free assisted driving technology. I visited the Mobileye team in Israel last month and was treated to an autonomous ride through the streets of Jerusalem. The progress we are making in Level 4 and Level 5 autonomy is extraordinary. Our mobility as a service JV with VW for deploying a commercial robotaxi service in Tel Aviv by 2022 is on track. Global coverage of REM, or Road Experience Management, mobilized real-time crowdsourced mapping capability, is expanding rapidly. Several major auto OEMs, most recently Ford, are adopting this breakthrough data-centric capability.
To understand the power of this data, consider this: 1.5 million kilometers is sent to the cloud daily from BMW production vehicles. With the data collected from just the last 4 weeks, Mobileye was able to automatically map 94% of the German autobahn and motorway network. And the commercial opportunity for REM extends beyond real-time maps for vehicles. Since announcing the agreement earlier this year, Mobileye and Ordnance Survey have jointly launched a service that delivers high-precision road network location data to companies across multiple sectors.
Artificial intelligence is a $10 billion data center silicon opportunity by 2023. And today, it's fueling cloud customer demand for solutions that accelerate demand in AI workloads. This is evidenced by the fact that key cloud customers, most recently Baidu, are collaborating on our Nervana Neural Network Processor for Training or NNP-T. NNP-T will sample to customers later this year, expanding our already diverse AI portfolio which spans multiple architectures, including ASICs like NNPI, TPUs, GPUs and FPGAs. All unified by single programming model, One API.
The second major element of our game plan is extending product leadership by accelerating the rate of innovation. The future of computing will require a solution-oriented mindset building on 6 pillars of innovation. Over the last 50 years, Intel has delivered breakthrough after breakthrough in computing performance that has propelled technology and society forward. We are far from finished as our product and customer announcements over the last quarter demonstrate.
Our Data Center Group just announced a very important strategic partnership with SAP to optimize Intel's platforms, including Xeon Scalable processors and Optane DC persistent memory for SAP's end-to-end enterprise software applications, including SAP S/4HANA. For over a decade, we have worked closely with SAP on developing differentiated breakthrough technologies that make organizations run more efficiently. The broadening of our strategic partnership with SAP will allow our mutual customers to accelerate their organization's digital transformation by deploying SAP business applications optimized for Intel-based infrastructure in the cloud, on-premises and in hybrid environments.
Our ecosystem partners have already received Ice Lake server samples. We are making good progress on Ice Lake server and are now planning to start production wafers in the first half of 2020 with the volume ramp in the second half of the year.
Both yield and defect density are ahead of schedule for our 10-nanometer data center products. Cascade Lake, which is ramping now, is on track to be one of our fastest ramping products ever, and we have a great solution for our customers in the first half of 2020 with Cooper Lake in the same platform as Ice Lake. We are working more deeply with our customers to understand their needs and become the partner that they rely on to innovate and grow their businesses. They challenge us. It's producing results, and it's making us better.
For example, in the second quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with Google to collaborate on Anthos, a new reference design based on the second-generation Xeon Scalable processor and an optimized Kubernetes software stack that will deliver increased workload portability to customers who want to take advantage of hybrid cloud environments. These deep customer engagements are frankly one of my favorite parts of the role.
We are constantly thinking about how we can help our data center customers harness the potential of data by processing, storing and moving it more efficiently. An essential part of the equation is interconnect technology, which is why we recently announced our intention to acquire Barefoot Networks. Barefoot Networks is an emerging leader in Ethernet switch silicon software with the programmability and flexibility necessary to meet the performance needs of the hyperscale cloud. We closed the transaction this week, and we are excited to have the Barefoot team as part of the Intel family.
Our client computing customers can loo

More intelligence is moving to the edge and more industries want to harness the power of data to create business value, innovate and grow. Devices and systems are becoming more autonomous. This is a trend IoTG is shaping and capitalizing on.\nOur team's work is producing outstanding results. In the second quarter, we grew at roughly 3x the market rate and are positioned to significantly outgrow the market over time. Here again, we saw demand for performance and strength across all verticals we serve with computer vision being an especially critical workload.\nMobileye is positioned to lead another huge opportunity, autonomous driving. This business has grown at more than 30% CAGR since we acquired them in 2017. Our market leadership continues to build momentum with 20 new design wins this year, representing 11 million lifetime units. Nissan's ProPILOT 2.0 and NIO's pilot vehicles have begun production featuring Mobileye-based L2+ system for hands-free assisted driving technology. I visited the Mobileye team in Israel last month and was treated to an autonomous ride through the streets of Jerusalem. The progress we are making in Level 4 and Level 5 autonomy is extraordinary. Our mobility as a service JV with VW for deploying a commercial robotaxi service in Tel Aviv by 2022 is on track. Global coverage of REM, or Road Experience Management, mobilized real-time crowdsourced mapping capability, is expanding rapidly. Several major auto OEMs, most recently Ford, are adopting this breakthrough data-centric capability.\nTo understand the power of this data, consider this: 1.5 million kilometers is sent to the cloud daily from BMW production vehicles. With the data collected from just the last 4 weeks, Mobileye was able to automatically map 94% of the German autobahn and motorway network. And the commercial opportunity for REM extends beyond real-time maps for vehicles. Since announcing the agreement earlier this year, Mobileye and Ordnance Survey have jointly launched a service that delivers high-precision road network location data to companies across multiple sectors.\nArtificial intelligence is a $10 billion data center silicon opportunity by 2023. And today, it's fueling cloud customer demand for solutions that accelerate demand in AI workloads. This is evidenced by the fact that key cloud customers, most recently Baidu, are collaborating on our Nervana Neural Network Processor for Training or NNP-T. NNP-T will sample to customers later this year, expanding our already diverse AI portfolio which spans multiple architectures, including ASICs like NNPI, TPUs, GPUs and FPGAs. All unified by single programming model, One API.\nThe second major element of our game plan is extending product leadership by accelerating the rate of innovation. The future of computing will require a solution-oriented mindset building on 6 pillars of innovation. Over the last 50 years, Intel has delivered breakthrough after breakthrough in computing performance that has propelled technology and society forward. We are far from finished as our product and customer announcements over the last quarter demonstrate.\nOur Data Center Group just announced a very important strategic partnership with SAP to optimize Intel's platforms, including Xeon Scalable processors and Optane DC persistent memory for SAP's end-to-end enterprise software applications, including SAP S/4HANA. For over a decade, we have worked closely with SAP on developing differentiated breakthrough technologies that make organizations run more efficiently. The broadening of our strategic partnership with SAP will allow our mutual customers to accelerate their organization's digital transformation by deploying SAP business applications optimized for Intel-based infrastructure in the cloud, on-premises and in hybrid environments.\nOur ecosystem partners have already received Ice Lake server samples. We are making good progress on Ice Lake server and are now planning to start production wafers in the first half of 2020 with the volume ramp in the second half of the year.\nBoth yield and defect density are ahead of schedule for our 10-nanometer data center products. Cascade Lake, which is ramping now, is on track to be one of our fastest ramping products ever, and we have a great solution for our customers in the first half of 2020 with Cooper Lake in the same platform as Ice Lake. We are working more deeply with our customers to understand their needs and become the partner that they rely on to innovate and grow their businesses. They challenge us. It's producing results, and it's making us better.\nFor example, in the second quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with Google to collaborate on Anthos, a new reference design based on the second-generation Xeon Scalable processor and an optimized Kubernetes software stack that will deliver increased workload portability to customers who want to take advantage of hybrid cloud environments. These deep customer engagements are frankly one of my favorite parts of the role.\nWe are constantly thinking about how we can help our data center customers harness the potential of data by processing, storing and moving it more efficiently. An essential part of the equation is interconnect technology, which is why we recently announced our intention to acquire Barefoot Networks. Barefoot Networks is an emerging leader in Ethernet switch silicon software with the programmability and flexibility necessary to meet the performance needs of the hyperscale cloud. We closed the transaction this week, and we are excited to have the Barefoot team as part of the Intel family.\nOur client computing customers can loo""}","Intel Corporation's Q2 2019 earnings highlight a period where performance exceeded the company's own expectations, reflecting strong customer preference for Intel's processing solutions amidst growing and diversifying workloads.

Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Mark. The second quarter was significantly stronger than we forecasted in April, and our results demonstrated our customers' preference for the performance of Intel XPUs as workloads grow, diversify and become increasingly complex. That need for performance manifested in strong mix in ASPs across the business. Our Q2 results are proof points for the megatrends that underpin our strategy. The world's insatiable appetite for data is driving demand for solutions to process, store and move it faster and better. Customers want to work with partners who can deliver performance and platforms to address their most important technology challenges.
Our data-centric businesses overall performed roughly in line with our April expectations. Data center and IoTG customers chose our highest-performing products leading to strong mix in ASPs. While our cloud customers absorb capacity they put in place over the last year, we continue to expect cloud demand to improve in the second half. Enterprise and government spending remains weak, however, particularly in China.
PC demand continued to improve, particularly in the commercial segment. We now expect the PC TAM to be up slightly for the full year. Strong demand for our highest-performing products and the productivity and TCO gains they deliver continues.
Mix was stronger than we anticipated. While small core supply improved, we were not able to fully satisfy customer demand for these SKUs in the second quarter. Tariffs and trade uncertainties created anxiety across our customers supply chain and drove a pull-in of client CPU orders into the second quarter.
We also halted shipments to certain customers in response to the U.S. government's revised entity list. After a thorough review, we were able to resume shipments of some products in compliance with regulations and the net impact on the second quarter was limited. While we hope and expect trade issues to be resolved, further tightening of export restrictions would come with revenue risk to our business. As a result, we enter the second half of the year a little more cautious than we were 90 days ago.
We met with many of you in May at our investor meeting where we outlined 3 major thrusts of our game plan to transform our company and grow. First, we're pursuing the largest opportunity in our company's history, a nearly $300 billion TAM comprised not just of CPUs for PCs and servers but of XPUs and adjacent technologies for an incredibly wide range of workloads and devices. Second, we're strengthening our product leadership by accelerating the rate of innovation. And third, we're evolving our culture and improving our execution so that we can play an even greater role in our customers' growth and success. I'll take a few minutes to share some of the progress we're making.
I'll start with expanding our opportunity and expanding our TAM. Over the last few years, we have dramatically expanded our served market while the PC market was declining. Our served market now is more than 5x larger and growing faster, and we have reallocated spending to expand our capabilities in higher-growth areas. We are evolving Intel Inside from a CPU inside a PC to XPUs inside everything that processes, stores and moves data. Big bets in 5G, AI and autonomous systems are an important part of this transformation.
In May, I outlined a disciplined framework for investing in and evaluating big bets as we expand into new markets. First, we'll invest where we have an opportunity to lead major technology inflections. Second, our investments should allow us to play a larger role in our customers' success. And finally, they must show a clear path to profitability and attractive returns.
Network infrastructure, which is transforming as the industry transitions to 5G, is one of our most important areas of investment, and we are laser-focused on this opportunity. This business has grown at a 40% CAGR since 2014 from just over $1 billion in revenue to more than $4 billion last year. The network cloudification that comes with 5G expands our opportunity in the core network and at the edge as more data moves closer to where it is created.
We expect to be in production on Snow Ridge, Intel's 10-nanometer system-on-chip technology for 5G base stations early next year. We've already announced that 2 large telecom equipment manufacturers have committed to this architecture, and we're on track to 40% share in this market segment by 2022.
While the 5G network opportunity meets each of our investment criteria, the 5G smartphone opportunity does not. This is why we decided to exit the 5G smartphone modem business and conduct an analysis of our options for the remaining parts of that portfolio. Today, we announced the sale of the majority of our 5G smartphone modem business to Apple. This deal preserves Intel's access to critical IP we have developed. It enables us to focus on the more profitable 5G network opportunity where we are growing and winning share.
Another growth market we're gaining share is the Internet of Things. We are using our architecture, accelerators and software assets combined with unmatched scale and partners to develop one of the industry's fastest-growing IoT portfolios. Taken together, the IoTG and Mobileye businesses grew at 22% over last year after adjusting for the sale of Wind River. More intelligence is moving to the edge and more industries want to harness the power of data to create business value, innovate and grow. Devices and systems are becoming more autonomous. This is a trend IoTG is shaping and capitalizing on.
Our team's work is producing outstanding results. In the second quarter, we grew at roughly 3x the market rate and are positioned to significantly outgrow the market over time. Here again, we saw demand for performance and strength across all verticals we serve with computer vision being an especially critical workload.
Mobileye is positioned to lead another huge opportunity, autonomous driving. This business has grown at more than 30% CAGR since we acquired them in 2017. Our market leadership continues to build momentum with 20 new design wins this year, representing 11 million lifetime units. Nissan's ProPILOT 2.0 and NIO's pilot vehicles have begun production featuring Mobileye-based L2+ system for hands-free assisted driving technology. I visited the Mobileye team in Israel last month and was treated to an autonomous ride through the streets of Jerusalem. The progress we are making in Level 4 and Level 5 autonomy is extraordinary. Our mobility as a service JV with VW for deploying a commercial robotaxi service in Tel Aviv by 2022 is on track.

NNP-T will sample to customers later this year, expanding our already diverse AI portfolio which spans multiple architectures, including ASICs like NNPI, TPUs, GPUs and FPGAs. All unified by single programming model, One API.
The second major element of our game plan is extending product leadership by accelerating the rate of innovation. The future of computing will require a solution-oriented mindset building on 6 pillars of innovation.

Since announcing the agreement earlier this year, Mobileye and Ordnance Survey have jointly launched a service that delivers high-precision road network location data to companies across multiple sectors.\nArtificial intelligence is a $10 billion data center silicon opportunity by 2023. And today, it's fueling cloud customer demand for solutions that accelerate demand in AI workloads. This is evidenced by the fact that key cloud customers, most recently Baidu, are collaborating on our Nervana Neural Network Processor for Training or NNP-T. NNP-T will sample to customers later this year, expanding our already diverse AI portfolio which spans multiple architectures, including ASICs like NNPI, TPUs, GPUs and FPGAs. All unified by single programming model, One API.\nThe second major element of our game plan is extending product leadership by accelerating the rate of innovation. The future of computing will require a solution-oriented mindset building on 6 pillars of innovation. Over the last 50 years, Intel has delivered breakthrough after breakthrough in computing performance that has propelled technology and society forward. We are far from finished as our product and customer announcements over the last quarter demonstrate.\nOur Data Center Group just announced a very important strategic partnership with SAP to optimize Intel's platforms, including Xeon Scalable processors and Optane DC persistent memory for SAP's end-to-end enterprise software applications, including SAP S/4HANA. For over a decade, we have worked closely with SAP on developing differentiated breakthrough technologies that make organizations run more efficiently. The broadening of our strategic partnership with SAP will allow our mutual customers to accelerate their organization's digital transformation by deploying SAP business applications optimized for Intel-based infrastructure in the cloud, on-premises and in hybrid environments.\nOur ecosystem partners have already received Ice Lake server samples. We are making good progress on Ice Lake server and are now planning to start production wafers in the first half of 2020 with the volume ramp in the second half of the year.\nBoth yield and defect density are ahead of schedule for our 10-nanometer data center products. Cascade Lake, which is ramping now, is on track to be one of our fastest ramping products ever, and we have a great solution for our customers in the first half of 2020 with Cooper Lake in the same platform as Ice Lake. We are working more deeply with our customers to understand their needs and become the partner that they rely on to innovate and grow their businesses. They challenge us. It's producing results, and it's making us better.\nFor example, in the second quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with Google to collaborate on Anthos, a new reference design based on the second-generation Xeon Scalable processor and an optimized Kubernetes software stack that will deliver increased workload portability to customers who want to take advantage of hybrid cloud environments. These deep customer engagements are frankly one of my favorite parts of the role.\nWe are constantly thinking about how we can help our data center customers harness the potential of data by processing, storing and moving it more efficiently. An essential part of the equation is interconnect technology, which is why we recently announced our intention to acquire Barefoot Networks. Barefoot Networks is an emerging leader in Ethernet switch silicon software with the programmability and flexibility necessary to meet the performance needs of the hyperscale cloud. We closed the transaction this week, and we are excited to have the Barefoot team as part of the Intel family.\nOur client computing customers can loo""}","Key Insights from the Earnings Call Transcript:

With that, let me hand it over to Brian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO and Director     [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Mark. The first quarter marked a great start to the year. Coming off both Q4 and full year records in 2016, Q1 revenue was up 7% over the first quarter of last year, a record Q1. And operating margin was up 20%. It was another milestone in our transformation from a PC-centric company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. Average selling prices or ASPs grew meaningfully across our PC, data center and IoT business, reflecting the market's demand for performance and our segmentation strategy. And our memory business set an all-time record revenue.
At our investor meeting in February, I outlined our strategy to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. I also detailed our top 4 priorities for the year: growing the data center and adjacencies; ensuring a strong and healthy PC business; growing IoT and devices; and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs. That's the framework we're using to measure our success throughout the year, and I'd like to take a few minutes to assess our progress so far.
First, the data center and its adjacencies. DCG grew 6% year-over-year despite a headwind resulting from a 14-week first quarter last year. The cloud service provider revenue was up 18%. The comms service provider segment was up 12%. And enterprise was down 3%, while non-CPU adjacencies grew more than 20% across all of the segments. Data center microprocessor ASPs were up in total across every product line, underscoring the market's demand for performance to transmit, aggregate and analyze data.
We're also on track for midsummer launch of our next-generation Skylake microprocessor. Skylake delivers significant performance gains across a wide range of workloads. For example, Skylake will include AVX-512 extensions that will deliver a 2x improvement in floating point operations per clock over the current generation, a gain that will have an especially high impact on HPC and artificial intelligence workloads.
And last month, we announced the formation of the artificial intelligence product group, bringing together all of our AI hardware and software assets and all of our AI engineering expertise across the company into a single group to accelerate our development of a full stack of AI solutions and explore novel approaches that will shape the next generation of AI products.
Second, a strong and healthy client business. Our annual cadence of product innovation, combined with a thoughtful segmentation strategy, continued to produce strong mix, which drove higher ASPs. This trend, along with our ramping modem business, drove revenue up 6% and operating margin up 60% over last year. Our expectations for the PC unit TAM haven't changed since we last talked with you. We're expecting a mid-single-digit percentage decline in the unit TAM. Our ASPs, however, are trending ahead of expectations and are contributing to our slightly higher revenue expectations for the full year.
Third, we've highlighted the importance of growing the IoT business as we drive and benefit from the rise of billions of smart and connected devices. IOTG revenue was up 11% year-over-year, where we saw strength in our industrial, video and automotive segments. We also announced our intention to acquire Mobileye, a highly profitable, fast-growing leader in computer vision for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. The transaction will combine mobilized expertise in computer vision with Intel's expertise in high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and connectivity. Together, we expect to be the global leader in the $70 billion autonomous driving systems, data and services opportunity by accelerating auto industry innovation and delivering cloud-to-car solutions faster and at a lower cost.
And finally, we emphasized the execution in memory and FPGAs. Our memory business grew 55% year-over-year in a tight supply environment; while Fab 68, our Dalian factory, continues to ramp 3D NAND production and is delivering outstanding product yields. We also shipped our first Optane SSDs for the data center and our Optane memory solution, which is available online now and in PC OEM systems later this quarter.
In our Programmable Solutions Group, revenue declined 7% over the last year after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges in the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decline was due to a weakness in the data center and comms segment, partially offset by growth in industrial and auto and consumer. We also announced an important pilot program with Alibaba cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, for our cloud-based FPGA acceleration service.
We're making good progress against our 4 top priorities for the year and our transformation goals. We're improving the profitability and health of our PC business. At the same time, our investments in the data center, IoT, memory and FPGAs are paying off with significant combined revenue growth. These are purposeful investments that will position Intel for years to come. At the same time, we recognize that there is an opportunity and responsibility to be more focused and efficient as a company, a goal we can achieve without compromising our most important investments: our transformation or our future.
Focus was one of our objectives in establishing McAfee as an independent cybersecurity company just weeks ago, and it is with efficiency in mind that we're making an important commitment to our owners today. We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30% of revenue, which I expect to reach no later than 2020. Following a 1 percentage point improvement from 2015 to 2016, we forecasted an additional 1 percentage point improvement in spending in 2017, and we're now expecting to do a little better than that. While we expect revenue growth to play a role in achieving these targets, hitting this goal will require spending discipline and an intense focus on our strategic priorities.
To sum up the quarter, we're off to a good start and executing well against our priorities. We're delivering a steady cadence of leading products, a powerful segmentation strategy and growing profitability in our client business. We're growing our data center, IoT and memory businesses as customers see data as a competitive advantage and look to Intel as a partner that can help them create, analyze and unlock the value of massive and growing flood of data. And finally, we are committing ourselves to a set of important new productivity goals intended to create value for our owners.
With that, I'll hand it over to Bob.

Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CFO and EVP    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Brian. 2016 was a record year for Intel, and 2017 is off to a strong start. We executed on several important milestones in the quarter. We delivered on innovative product and technology road maps across the business. Fab 68 in Dalian continued its impressive ramp. And Intel's transformation continued with the planned acquisition of Mobileye for autonomous driving and the sale of the Intel Security Group.
Revenue was $14.8 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Operating income was $3.9 billion, up 20% year-over-year. And earnings per share of $0.66 was up 22% year-over-year. Our EPS performance was a result of strong top line growth and significant margin expansion. First quarter operating margin was 27%, up 3 points year-over-year, and gross margin came in at 63%, up 0.5 point year-over-year. Direct spending came in at $5.4 billion, flat year-over-year and down 2 points as a percent of revenue from 2016 as we continued to execute on our restructuring program.
Let me touch briefly on our segment performance. The Client Computing Group had revenue of $8 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We continue to see the worldwide PC supply chain operate at healthy levels. Client ASPs were up 7% year-over-year as our segmentation strategies are paying off and core mix continues to be strong. This segment had yet another quarter of significant profit growth with operating profit growing over 60% from a year ago as the business continues to execute and benefit from continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit cost, richer product mix and lower spending, primarily from the client business having a decreased share of technology development and SG&A allocations.
The Data Center Group had revenue of $4.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.5 billion, down 16% year-over-year. Operating margin percent was impacted by increased allocation of technology development and SG&A cost, higher product cost as we transitioned to 14-nanometer and the ramp of adjacency products.
Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $721 million, growing 11% year-over-year, driven by strength in the industrial and video segments and continued momentum in our automotive business. Operating profit for the business was $105 million, down 15% year-over-year from increased investments in autonomous driving and increased allocation of SG&A and technology development spending.
Our memory business had record revenue of $866 million, up 55% year-over-year, with strong demand for data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply. We continue to make outstanding progress ramping Fab 68 with yields and unit costs well ahead of expectations. This segment had an operating loss of $129 million largely driven by costs related with 3D XPoint and start-up costs for our memory capacity.
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $425 million. Operating profit was $92 million, flat year-over-year after adjusting for acquisition-related impacts.
Our Intel Security Group business had revenue of $534 million, and operating profit was $95 million. Consistent with our prior guidance, the Intel Security transaction closed at the beginning of the second quarter.
Let me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and our progress: first, invest in our business; second, strategic acquisitions; and third, return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In the quarter, we generated $3.9 billion of cash from operations. We repurchased $2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends, increased the dividend by 5% and repurchased about $1.2 billion of stock. In addition, we generated approximately $400 million from the sale of some of our interest in ASML, which generated $235 million of pretax gains. At quarter-end, cash and other long-term investments was $23.7 billion, up $600 million. Total

Operating margin percent was impacted by increased allocation of technology development and SG&A cost, higher product cost as we transitioned to 14-nanometer and the ramp of adjacency products.\nOur Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $721 million, growing 11% year-over-year, driven by strength in the industrial and video segments and continued momentum in our automotive business. Operating profit for the business was $105 million, down 15% year-over-year from increased investments in autonomous driving and increased allocation of SG&A and technology development spending.\nOur memory business had record revenue of $866 million, up 55% year-over-year, with strong demand for data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply. We continue to make outstanding progress ramping Fab 68 with yields and unit costs well ahead of expectations. This segment had an operating loss of $129 million largely driven by costs related with 3D XPoint and start-up costs for our memory capacity.\nThe Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $425 million. Operating profit was $92 million, flat year-over-year after adjusting for acquisition-related impacts.\nOur Intel Security Group business had revenue of $534 million, and operating profit was $95 million. Consistent with our prior guidance, the Intel Security transaction closed at the beginning of the second quarter.\nLet me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and our progress: first, invest in our business; second, strategic acquisitions; and third, return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In the quarter, we generated $3.9 billion of cash from operations. We repurchased $2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends, increased the dividend by 5% and repurchased about $1.2 billion of stock. In addition, we generated approximately $400 million from the sale of some of our interest in ASML, which generated $235 million of pretax gains. At quarter-end, cash and other long-term investments was $23.7 billion, up $600 million. Total ""}","**Intel Corp Q1 2017 Earnings Call Insights**

          Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. 
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Mark Henninger, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Henninger,   -     [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Crystal, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com.
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Bob Swan, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we'll be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.
And finally, I'd like to draw your attention to a change we've made to our guidance practices for the current quarter and full year. Beginning with today's earnings release for the first quarter of 2017, our business outlook will speak only as of the date of our quarterly earnings releases, bringing our practices in line with virtually all of our peers.
With that, let me hand it over to Brian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO and Director     [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Mark. The first quarter marked a great start to the year. Coming off both Q4 and full year records in 2016, Q1 revenue was up 7% over the first quarter of last year, a record Q1. And operating margin was up 20%. It was another milestone in our transformation from a PC-centric company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. Average selling prices or ASPs grew meaningfully across our PC, data center and IoT business, reflecting the market's demand for performance and our segmentation strategy. And our memory business set an all-time record revenue.
At our investor meeting in February, I outlined our strategy to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. I also detailed our top 4 priorities for the year: growing the data center and adjacencies; ensuring a strong and healthy PC business; growing IoT and devices; and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs. That's the framework we're using to measure our success throughout the year, and I'd like to take a few minutes to assess our progress so far.
First, the data center and its adjacencies. DCG grew 6% year-over-year despite a headwind resulting from a 14-week first quarter last year. The cloud service provider revenue was up 18%. The comms service provider segment was up 12%. And enterprise was down 3%, while non-CPU adjacencies grew more than 20% across all of the segments. Data center microprocessor ASPs were up in total across every product line, underscoring the market's demand for performance to transmit, aggregate and analyze data.
We're also on track for midsummer launch of our next-generation Skylake microprocessor. Skylake delivers significant performance gains across a wide range of workloads. For example, Skylake will include AVX-512 extensions that will deliver a 2x improvement in floating point operations per clock over the current generation, a gain that will have an especially high impact on HPC and artificial intelligence workloads.
And last month, we announced the formation of the artificial intelligence product group, bringing together all of our AI hardware and software assets and all of our AI engineering expertise across the company into a single group to accelerate our development of a full stack of AI solutions and explore novel approaches that will shape the next generation of AI products.
Second, a strong and healthy client business. Our annual cadence of product innovation, combined with a thoughtful segmentation strategy, continued to produce strong mix, which drove higher ASPs. This trend, along with our ramping modem business, drove revenue up 6% and operating margin up 60% over last year. Our expectations for the PC unit TAM haven't changed since we last talked with you. We're expecting a mid-single-digit percentage decline in the unit TAM. Our ASPs, however, are trending ahead of expectations and are contributing to our slightly higher revenue expectations for the full year.
Third, we've highlighted the importance of growing the IoT business as we drive and benefit from the rise of billions of smart and connected devices. IOTG revenue was up 11% year-over-year, where we saw strength in our industrial, video and automotive segments. We also announced our intention to acquire Mobileye, a highly profitable, fast-growing leader in computer vision for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. The transaction will combine mobilized expertise in computer vision with Intel's expertise in high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and connectivity. Together, we expect to be the global leader in the $70 billion autonomous driving systems, data and services opportunity by accelerating auto industry innovation and delivering cloud-to-car solutions faster and at a lower cost.
And finally, we emphasized the execution in memory and FPGAs. Our memory business grew 55% year-over-year in a tight supply environment; while Fab 68, our Dalian factory, continues to ramp 3D NAND production and is delivering outstanding product yields. We also shipped our first Optane SSDs for the data center and our Optane memory solution, which is available online now and in PC OEM systems later this quarter.
In our Programmable Solutions Group, revenue declined 7% over the last year after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges in the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decline was due to a weakness in the data center and comms segment, partially offset by growth in industrial and auto and consumer. We also announced an important pilot program with Alibaba cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, for our cloud-based FPGA acceleration service.
We're making good progress against our 4 top priorities for the year and our transformation goals. We're improving the profitability and health of our PC business. At the same time, our investments in the data center, IoT, memory and FPGAs are paying off with significant combined revenue growth. These are purposeful investments that will position Intel for years to come. At the same time, we recognize that there is an opportunity and responsibility to be more focused and efficient as a company, a goal we can achieve without compromising our most important investments: our transformation or our future.
Focus was one of our objectives in establishing McAfee as an independent cybersecurity company just weeks ago, and it is with efficiency in mind that we're making an important commitment to our owners today. We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30% of revenue, which I expect to reach no later than 2020. Following a 1 percentage point improvement from 2015 to 2016, we forecasted an additional 1 percentage point improvement in spending in 2017, and we're now expecting to do a little better than that. While we expect revenue growth to play a role in achieving these targets, hitting this goal will require spending discipline and an intense focus on our strategic priorities.
To sum up the quarter, we're off to a good start and executing well against our priorities. We're delivering a steady cadence of leading products, a powerful segmentation strategy and growing profitability in our client business. We're growing our data center, IoT and memory businesses as customers see data as a competitive advantage and look to Intel as a partner that can help them create, analyze and unlock the value of massive and growing flood of data. And finally, we are committing ourselves to a set of important new productivity goals intended to create value for our owners.
With that, I'll hand it over to Bob.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Brian. 2016 was a record year for Intel, and 2017 is off to a strong start. We executed on several important milestones in the quarter. We delivered on innovative product and technology road maps across the business. Fab 68 in Dalian continued its impressive ramp. And Intel's transformation continued with the planned acquisition of Mobileye for autonomous driving and the sale of the Intel Security Group.
Revenue was $14.8 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Operating income was $3.9 billion, up 20% year-over-year. And earnings per share of $0.66 was up 22% year-over-year. Our EPS performance was a result of strong top line growth and significant margin expansion. First quarter operating margin was 27%, up 3 points year-over-year, and gross margin came in at 63%, up 0.5 point year-over-year. Direct spending came in at $5.4 billion, flat year-over-year and down 2 points as a percent of revenue from 2016 as we continued to execute on our restructuring program.
Let me touch briefly on our segment performance. The Client Computing Group had revenue of $8 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We continue to see the worldwide PC supply chain operate at healthy levels. Client ASPs were up 7% year-over-year as our segmentation strategies are paying off and core mix continues to be strong. This segment had yet another quarter of significant profit growth with operating profit growing over 60% from a year ago as the business continues to execute and benefit from continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit cost, richer product mix and lower spending, primarily from the client business having a decreased share of technology development and SG&A allocations.
The Data Center Group had revenue of $4.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.5 billion, down 16% year-over-year. Operating margin percent was impacted by increased allocation of technology development and SG&A cost, higher product cost as we transitioned to 14-nanometer and the ramp of adjacency products.
Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $721 million, growing 11% year-over-year, driven by strength in the industrial and video segments and continued momentum in our automotive business. Operating profit for the business was $105 million, down 15% year-over-year from increased investments in autonomous driving and increased allocation of SG&A and technology development spending.
Our memory business had record revenue of $866 million, up 55% year-over-year, with strong demand for data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply. We continue to make outstanding progress ramping Fab 68 with yields and unit costs well ahead of expectations. This segment had an operating loss of $129 million largely driven by costs related with 3D XPoint and start-up costs for our memory capacity.
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $425 million. Operating profit was $92 million, flat year-over-year after adjusting for acquisition-related impacts.
Our Intel Security Group business had revenue of $534 million, and operating profit was $95 million. Consistent with our prior guidance, the Intel Security transaction closed at the beginning of the second quarter.
Let me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and our progress: first, invest in our business; second, strategic acquisitions; and third, return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In the quarter, we generated $3.9 billion of cash from operations. We repurchased $2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends, increased the dividend by 5% and repurchased about $1.2 billion of stock. In addition, we generated approximately $400 million from the sale of some of our interest in ASML, which generated $235 million of pretax gains. At quarter-end, cash and other long-term investments was $23.7 billion, up $600 million. Total

This segment had an operating loss of $129 million largely driven by costs related with 3D XPoint and start-up costs for our memory capacity.\nThe Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $425 million. Operating profit was $92 million, flat year-over-year after adjusting for acquisition-related impacts.\nOur Intel Security Group business had revenue of $534 million, and operating profit was $95 million. Consistent with our prior guidance, the Intel Security transaction closed at the beginning of the second quarter.\nLet me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and our progress: first, invest in our business; second, strategic acquisitions; and third, return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In the quarter, we generated $3.9 billion of cash from operations. We repurchased $2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends, increased the dividend by 5% and repurchased about $1.2 billion of stock. In addition, we generated approximately $400 million from the sale of some of our interest in ASML, which generated $235 million of pretax gains. At quarter-end, cash and other long-term investments was $23.7 billion, up $600 million. Total ""}","Key Insights from the Transcript:

Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Mark. Coming off a record 2017, 2018 is off to an exceptionally strong start. Q1 was Intel's best first quarter ever and significantly exceeded the expectations we set in January. Our Client Computing Group continue to execute well, producing growth within a declining PC market. And our transformation to a data-centric company accelerated with our data-centric businesses, booting McAfee up 25% over the first quarter of last year. 
The strength of Intel's business underscores my confidence in our strategy. What we're seeing is an unrelenting demand for compute performance driven by the continuing growth of data and the need to process, analyze, store and share that data. That dynamic benefits our traditional CPU business and it reinforces the big bets we've made in memory, modems, FPGAs and autonomous vehicles. We're competing to win in our largest collection of addressable markets ever. And importantly, we're not just competing in these markets. We're leading and shaping them as our first quarter results demonstrate. 
Data Center Group revenue was up 24% year-over-year. We saw broad-based demand strength across all DCG segments in Q1. And customer preference for high performance products, including Xeon Scalable drove a richer ASP mix. 
The cloud segment grew 45%. And in the comm service provider segment, we continue to take share and grew revenue 33% as customers chose IA-based solutions to virtualize and transform their networks as the industry prepares for the 5G transition. 
Intel's presence at the Winter Olympics in Pyongyang was a powerful showcase of our 5G capability. Intel and KT deployed the world's largest 5G network to date, including more than 20 5G links delivering 3,800 terabytes of network capacity. We've established leadership in 5G. And when commercial networks begin deploying around 2019, we'll be there with industry-leading products from the core of the data center to the edge to mobile devices. 
And we also saw growth in our enterprise segments for the second consecutive quarter as macro strength continued and customers prioritized hybrid and on-premises infrastructure investments. Data center customers are also looking to FPGAs for workload acceleration. The Programmable Solutions Group again set a record for design win volume, and those design wins are translating directly into revenue. 
PSG's business grew 17% in Q1 on data center and embedded strength along with last time buys. PSG's data center segment was up 150% over last year, and the Advanced products category, our 28-, 20- and 14-nanometer solutions grew more than 40%. 
Microsoft also recently announced that they're using Intel's FPGAs to power new Bing intelligent search features using real-time AI. PSG's momentum is evidence that our 2016 acquisition of Altera is delivering value for our customers and contributing directly to Intel's growth. 
Our IoTG business grew 17% on record unit volume with continuing momentum in the retail and video segment as compute increasingly moves to the edge. Consistent with our commitment to be disciplined with our resources, we made the decision to divest Wind River and sharpen the focus of IoTG on other growth opportunities that more closely align to our strategy. 
The memory business set a revenue record, growing 20% in the first quarter, crossing over the $1 billion mark in revenue. The last business that passed that mark was DCG, crossing over that mark over a decade ago. 
Both yields and output in our Dalian factory continue to ramp ahead of schedule. In fact, we believe the Dalian Fab extension is one of the fastest brownfield of wafer starts projects in memory industry history. 
We also launched our first mainstream Optane SSDs for clients, known as the 800 series, driving further industry adoption of this revolutionary technology. The NSG remains on track to be profitable for the full year. 
And we continue to demonstrate momentum in autonomous driving, and I'm happy to report that the Intel Mobileye autonomous vehicle test fleet has begun to operate in Israel and will expand to other geographies in the coming months. Our fleet fully implements the Responsible Sensitive Safety system or RSS that we introduced last year. This unique system applies a formal, common sense safety field to the vehicle's decision making, resulting in the optimal combination of provable safety and humanlike driving style. We believe that the winning path to autonomous driving will be a progression from ADAS capabilities to full autonomous driving. And we're seeing significant momentum in the marketplace, including a recent high-volume design win for EyeQ5 with a European premium vehicle manufacturer. 
And finally, the Client Computing Group extended its strong track record of execution in a challenging PC environment. The revenue was up 3% despite a declining PC TAM on strength in the commercial and enthusiast segments, leading to a strong core mix. The CCG launched its first ever i9 processors for laptops in the first quarter, again demonstrating our outright product leadership. 
We continue to make progress on our 10-nanometer process. We are shipping in low volume and yields are improving, so the rate of improvement is slower than we anticipated. As a result, volume production is moving from the second half of 2018 into 2019. We understand the yield issues and have defined improvements for them, but they will take time to implement and qualify. We have leadership products on the road map that continue to take advantage of 14-nanometer with Whiskey Lake for Client and Cascade Lake for the data center coming later this year. 
Moore's Law is essential to our strategy and our product leadership. It continues to create significant value for Intel and our customers. While it's taking longer and costing more to deliver and yield advanced process technologies, we are able to optimize our process and products within a node to deliver meaningful performance improvements. For example, 14-nanometer process optimizations and architectural improvements have resulted in performance gains of more than 70% since the first 14-nanometer products were launched. We combined these advances in manufacturing technology and architecture that produced truly a leadership product, and it's that product leadership that ultimately matters most to our customers and end users. 
Intel and the industry stepped up for a tough challenge as we responded to the security vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown. I'm pleased with our progress and proud of how Intel and industry partners address this issue collaboratively, with transparency and with customer-first urgency. We're delivering against our security-first pledge and we've now rolled out micro code-based mitigation for all Intel products launched over the last 9 years that require protection against Spectre and Meltdown. 
We'll also begin delivering both client and data center products with the hardware-based mitigations later this year. 
With our Data centric transformation accelerating, we're raising our expectations for our full year results, yet more evidence that our strategy is working. As Intel marks its 50th anniversary, we're well positioned to be the end-to-end platform provider for the new data world and the leader in artificial intelligence and the autonomous revolution. 
With that, let me hand it over to Bob.

Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Brian. Q1 was truly an outstanding start to 2018. Our transformation to a data-centric company continues to build momentum. Revenue was a first quarter record of $16.1 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Operating income was $4.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year. And EPS of $0.87 was up 32% year-over-year. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we generated $6.3 billion of cash flow from operations and returned $3.3 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividend. As a result of the strength we are seeing in the business, we are raising our full year revenue guide by $2.5 billion to $67.5 billion. We're raising our EPS guide by $0.30 to $3.85. And we're raising our free cash flow guide by $1.5 billion to $14.5 billion. 
Our Q1 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. Intel's data-centric businesses were up 25% collectively with each business individually growing double digits. Our data-centric businesses are now approaching 50% of our revenue, an all-time high. 
Our PC-centric business was up 3% on strength in notebook, desktop and modem. DCG strong cash flows fund Intel's investment in new data-centric growth. 
As a reminder, we adopted a new revenue recognition standard in Q1. The new standard drove $462 million in incremental Q1 revenue recognition. This predominantly affected CCG and NSG. By year-end, we expect roughly half of this to net out. 
Moving to Q1 earnings. We generated significant EPS expansion in the quarter, up 32% year-on-year. Our non-GAAP EPS improvement was driven by strong top line growth, a 3-point improvement in operating margins and an 11-point reduction in our effective tax rate. The 3-point improvement in operating margins were driven by a 4-point reduction in spending, partially offset by a 1 point decline in gross margin. The 1 point decline in gross margin was driven by growth in our adjacencies, which have lower gross margins than our CPU products. 
From a spending standpoint, versus last year, we delivered $1.3 billion more revenue on $200 million less spending. 
As a second reminder, we adopted a new mark-to-market standard for our equity investments. In 2017, all realized gains and losses were recorded in our non-GAAP results. But in 2018, all mark-to-market adjustments flow through earnings. In an effort to eliminate volatility, we have excluded these adjustments from our non-GAAP results. Our Q1 GAAP EPS included approximately $0.13 for mark-to-market gains in our ICAP portfolio that were excluded from our non-GAAP results. 
We are also making excellent progress in our operating efficiencies. In January, we pulled in our 30% spending goal from 2020 to 2019, and we're off to a good start in 2018. Total spending was down 4% year-over-year in the quarter. R&D spending as a percentage of revenue was down approximately 2 points. And our SG&A costs were down over 2 points. Our intensity on spending is designed to accelerate top line growth, and it is paying off. Currently, as a result of strong top line growth, we now expect to meet our 30% spending target in 2018, 2 years ahead of our original expectations. 
Let me touch briefly on our Q1 performance by segment. The Data Center Group delivered a great quarter, much better than expected. DCG revenue of $5.2 billion was up 24% year-over-year, and operating income of $2.6 billion grew 75%. Q1 operating margin was 50%. Overall, unit volume was up 16%, and ASPs were up 7%. 
We saw broad-based demand strength in Q1 with customer preference for high-

Our intensity on spending is designed to accelerate top line growth, and it is paying off. Currently, as a result of strong top line growth, we now expect to meet our 30% spending target in 2018, 2 years ahead of our original expectations. \nLet me touch briefly on our Q1 performance by segment. The Data Center Group delivered a great quarter, much better than expected. DCG revenue of $5.2 billion was up 24% year-over-year, and operating income of $2.6 billion grew 75%. Q1 operating margin was 50%. Overall, unit volume was up 16%, and ASPs were up 7%. \nWe saw broad-based demand strength in Q1 with customer preference for high-""}","Intel Corporation reported a robust performance during the first quarter of 2018, according to the earnings call transcript dated April 26, 2018. The following are the detailed insights categorized by themes:

**Financial Performance:**
- Revenue: Q1 brought in a record high of $16.1 billion, marking an increase of 13% year-over-year. This was driven by both data-centric businesses, which collectively grew by 25%, and the PC-centric business, which saw a 3% increase. 
- Operating Income: Registered at $4.8 billion, representing a significant rise of 21% from the previous year.
- Earnings Per Share (EPS): Non-GAAP EPS was $0.87, up by 32% year-over-year.
- Cash Flow: The cash flow from operations amounted to $6.3 billion.
- Shareholder Returns: $3.3 billion was returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.

**Growth Drivers and Industry Dynamics:**
- Data-Centric Businesses: Nearly 50% of total revenue, reaching an all-time high, with each individual segment growing by double digits.
- PC-Centric Business: Gained strength even in a declining PC market, growing due to the success in the notebook, desktop, and modem sectors.
- Data Center Group (DCG): Saw a revenue increase of 24% year over year to $5.2 billion, with operating income growing a substantial 75% to $2.6 billion. The group experienced a unit volume increase of 16%, and average selling prices (ASPs) went up by 7%. Enterprise segment revenue growth continued for the second consecutive quarter driven by hybrid and on-premises infrastructure investment.

**Operational Efficiencies and Expenses:**
- Spending was decreased by 4% year over year with $1.3 billion more revenue generated on $200 million less spending.
- Research and Development (R&D): Spending as a percentage of revenue has decreased by roughly 2 points year over year.
- Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A): Costs decreased by 2 points from the previous year.

**Product and Market Leadership:**
- Innovations: Adoption of Xeon Scalable processors, Intel's FPGAs, and Optane SSDs contributed largely to the company's growth.
- Memory Business: Set a revenue record, growing 20% in the first quarter, surpassing the $1 billion revenue mark.

**Strategic Decisions:**
- 10-Nanometer Process: Shipment in low volume with improving yields; however, full production is pushed to 2019 due to yield issues.
- Divestiture: Decision to divest Wind River to focus more tightly on critical areas of growth.

**Guidance and Forward Outlook:**

Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Mark. Coming off a record 2017, 2018 is off to an exceptionally strong start. Q1 was Intel's best first quarter ever and significantly exceeded the expectations we set in January. Our Client Computing Group continue to execute well, producing growth within a declining PC market. And our transformation to a data-centric company accelerated with our data-centric businesses, booting McAfee up 25% over the first quarter of last year. 
The strength of Intel's business underscores my confidence in our strategy. What we're seeing is an unrelenting demand for compute performance driven by the continuing growth of data and the need to process, analyze, store and share that data. That dynamic benefits our traditional CPU business and it reinforces the big bets we've made in memory, modems, FPGAs and autonomous vehicles. We're competing to win in our largest collection of addressable markets ever. And importantly, we're not just competing in these markets. We're leading and shaping them as our first quarter results demonstrate. 
Data Center Group revenue was up 24% year-over-year. We saw broad-based demand strength across all DCG segments in Q1. And customer preference for high performance products, including Xeon Scalable drove a richer ASP mix. 
The cloud segment grew 45%. And in the comm service provider segment, we continue to take share and grew revenue 33% as customers chose IA-based solutions to virtualize and transform their networks as the industry prepares for the 5G transition. 
Intel's presence at the Winter Olympics in Pyongyang was a powerful showcase of our 5G capability. Intel and KT deployed the world's largest 5G network to date, including more than 20 5G links delivering 3,800 terabytes of network capacity. We've established leadership in 5G. And when commercial networks begin deploying around 2019, we'll be there with industry-leading products from the core of the data center to the edge to mobile devices. 
And we also saw growth in our enterprise segments for the second consecutive quarter as macro strength continued and customers prioritized hybrid and on-premises infrastructure investments. Data center customers are also looking to FPGAs for workload acceleration. The Programmable Solutions Group again set a record for design win volume, and those design wins are translating directly into revenue. 
PSG's business grew 17% in Q1 on data center and embedded strength along with last time buys. PSG's data center segment was up 150% over last year, and the Advanced products category, our 28-, 20- and 14-nanometer solutions grew more than 40%. 
Microsoft also recently announced that they're using Intel's FPGAs to power new Bing intelligent search features using real-time AI. PSG's momentum is evidence that our 2016 acquisition of Altera is delivering value for our customers and contributing directly to Intel's growth. 
Our IoTG business grew 17% on record unit volume with continuing momentum in the retail and video segment as compute increasingly moves to the edge. Consistent with our commitment to be disciplined with our resources, we made the decision to divest Wind River and sharpen the focus of IoTG on other growth opportunities that more closely align to our strategy. 
The memory business set a revenue record, growing 20% in the first quarter, crossing over the $1 billion mark in revenue. The last business that passed that mark was DCG, crossing over that mark over a decade ago. 
Both yields and output in our Dalian factory continue to ramp ahead of schedule. In fact, we believe the Dalian Fab extension is one of the fastest brownfield of wafer starts projects in memory industry history. 
We also launched our first mainstream Optane SSDs for clients, known as the 800 series, driving further industry adoption of this revolutionary technology. The NSG remains on track to be profitable for the full year. 
And we continue to demonstrate momentum in autonomous driving, and I'm happy to report that the Intel Mobileye autonomous vehicle test fleet has begun to operate in Israel and will expand to other geographies in the coming months. Our fleet fully implements the Responsible Sensitive Safety system or RSS that we introduced last year. This unique system applies a formal, common sense safety field to the vehicle's decision making, resulting in the optimal combination of provable safety and humanlike driving style. We believe that the winning path to autonomous driving will be a progression from ADAS capabilities to full autonomous driving. And we're seeing significant momentum in the marketplace, including a recent high-volume design win for EyeQ5 with a European premium vehicle manufacturer. 
And finally, the Client Computing Group extended its strong track record of execution in a challenging PC environment. The revenue was up 3% despite a declining PC TAM on strength in the commercial and enthusiast segments, leading to a strong core mix. The CCG launched its first ever i9 processors for laptops in the first quarter, again demonstrating our outright product leadership. 
We continue to make progress on our 10-nanometer process. We are shipping in low volume and yields are improving, so the rate of improvement is slower than we anticipated. As a result, volume production is moving from the second half of 2018 into 2019. We understand the yield issues and have defined improvements for them, but they will take time to implement and qualify. We have leadership products on the road map that continue to take advantage of 14-nanometer with Whiskey Lake for Client and Cascade Lake for the data center coming later this year. 
Moore's Law is essential to our strategy and our product leadership. It continues to create significant value for Intel and our customers. While it's taking longer and costing more to deliver and yield advanced process technologies, we are able to optimize our process and products within a node to deliver meaningful performance improvements. For example, 14-nanometer process optimizations and architectural improvements have resulted in performance gains of more than 70% since the first 14-nanometer products were launched. We combined these advances in manufacturing technology and architecture that produced truly a leadership product, and it's that product leadership that ultimately matters most to our customers and end users. 
Intel and the industry stepped up for a tough challenge as we responded to the security vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown. I'm pleased with our progress and proud of how Intel and industry partners address this issue collaboratively, with transparency and with customer-first urgency. We're delivering against our security-first pledge and we've now rolled out micro code-based mitigation for all Intel products launched over the last 9 years that require protection against Spectre and Meltdown. 
We'll also begin delivering both client and data center products with the hardware-based mitigations later this year. 
With our Data centric transformation accelerating, we're raising our expectations for our full year results, yet more evidence that our strategy is working. As Intel marks its 50th anniversary, we're well positioned to be the end-to-end platform provider for the new data world and the leader in artificial intelligence and the autonomous revolution. 
With that, let me hand it over to Bob.

Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Brian. Q1 was truly an outstanding start to 2018. Our transformation to a data-centric company continues to build momentum. Revenue was a first quarter record of $16.1 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Operating income was $4.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year. And EPS of $0.87 was up 32% year-over-year. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we generated $6.3 billion of cash flow from operations and returned $3.3 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividend. As a result of the strength we are seeing in the business, we are raising our full year revenue guide by $2.5 billion to $67.5 billion. We're raising our EPS guide by $0.30 to $3.85. And we're raising our free cash flow guide by $1.5 billion to $14.5 billion. 
Our Q1 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. Intel's data-centric businesses were up 25% collectively with each business individually growing double digits. Our data-centric businesses are now approaching 50% of our revenue, an all-time high. 
Our PC-centric business was up 3% on strength in notebook, desktop and modem. DCG strong cash flows fund Intel's investment in new data-centric growth. 
As a reminder, we adopted a new revenue recognition standard in Q1. The new standard drove $462 million in incremental Q1 revenue recognition. This predominantly affected CCG and NSG. By year-end, we expect roughly half of this to net out. 
Moving to Q1 earnings. We generated significant EPS expansion in the quarter, up 32% year-on-year. Our non-GAAP EPS improvement was driven by strong top line growth, a 3-point improvement in operating margins and an 11-point reduction in our effective tax rate. The 3-point improvement in operating margins were driven by a 4-point reduction in spending, partially offset by a 1 point decline in gross margin. The 1 point decline in gross margin was driven by growth in our adjacencies, which have lower gross margins than our CPU products. 
From a spending standpoint, versus last year, we delivered $1.3 billion more revenue on $200 million less spending. 
As a second reminder, we adopted a new mark-to-market standard for our equity investments. In 2017, all realized gains and losses were recorded in our non-GAAP results. But in 2018, all mark-to-market adjustments flow through earnings. In an effort to eliminate volatility, we have excluded these adjustments from our non-GAAP results. Our Q1 GAAP EPS included approximately $0.13 for mark-to-market gains in our ICAP portfolio that were excluded from our non-GAAP results. 
We are also making excellent progress in our operating efficiencies. In January, we pulled in our 30% spending goal from 2020 to 2019, and we're off to a good start in 2018. Total spending was down 4% year-over-year in the quarter. R&D spending as a percentage of revenue was down approximately 2 points. And our SG&A costs were down over 2 points. Our intensity on spending is designed to accelerate top line growth, and it is paying off. Currently, as a result of strong top line growth, we now expect to meet our 30% spending target in 2018, 2 years ahead of our original expectations. 
Let me touch briefly on our Q1 performance by segment. The Data Center Group delivered a great quarter, much better than expected. DCG revenue of $5.2 billion was up 24% year-over-year, and operating income of $2.6 billion grew 75%. Q1 operating margin was 50%. Overall, unit volume was up 16%, and ASPs were up 7%. 
We saw broad-based demand strength in Q1 with customer preference for high-

In January, we pulled in our 30% spending goal from 2020 to 2019, and we're off to a good start in 2018. Total spending was down 4% year-over-year in the quarter. R&D spending as a percentage of revenue was down approximately 2 points. And our SG&A costs were down over 2 points. Our intensity on spending is designed to accelerate top line growth, and it is paying off. Currently, as a result of strong top line growth, we now expect to meet our 30% spending target in 2018, 2 years ahead of our original expectations. \nLet me touch briefly on our Q1 performance by segment. The Data Center Group delivered a great quarter, much better than expected. DCG revenue of $5.2 billion was up 24% year-over-year, and operating income of $2.6 billion grew 75%. Q1 operating margin was 50%. Overall, unit volume was up 16%, and ASPs were up 7%. \nWe saw broad-based demand strength in Q1 with customer preference for high-""}","Key insights from the earnings call transcript for Intel Corporation's Q1 2018 include:
